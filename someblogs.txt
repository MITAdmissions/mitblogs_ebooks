 Congratulations to the incoming Class of 2018!  Each and every one of you is incredible, and I am so excited to see your happy faces light up the institute once again in the fall!   So now you've decided to go to MIT, but you haven't paid a dime or picked a class yet. The biggest thing on your plate right now is figuring out when to take the Freshman Essay Evaluation (FEE) or which pre-orientation program to take. Meanwhile, all your other friends are picking out their schedule for the fall. Some of them already know where they are living, and maybe they even entered a randomized lottery to get placed in their basic required classes that everyone else is getting placed in.  MIT is different from other schools. I want to lay out some basics about what you might want or need to know about your freshmen year.  I've learned a lot through my own experiences from my first year at MIT, as well as through being an associate advisor my sophomore year.  Here is my advice! And also some descriptions of what will be required of you as a frosh. Do a Freshman Pre-Orientation Program (FPOP) The applications are due June 15th! SIGN UP FOR AN FPOP!! There is an awesome Mark Twain quote on the FPOP website: "Twenty Years from now you will be more disappointed by the things you didn't do than by the ones you did. So throw off the bowlines. Sail away from the safe harbor. Catch the trade winds in your sails. Explore. Dream."                                       - Mark Twain (1835-1910) I think Mark Twain and MIT admissions painted the right picture for you - FPOPs are a great opportunity for you to do things outside of your comfort zone, and it also is the perfect way for you to start making friends that will last you your four years at MIT and beyond.  The FPOPs range from aerospace to computer science to energy to leadership to exercise to literature to product design and SO MUCH MORE! This year there are twenty-two FPOPs offered in August, and each one gives an amazing introduction to MIT and the beautiful city that surrounds us. My experience includes doing the Freshman Urban Planning FPOP as a frosh, and working as a mentor for the Discover Materials Science & Engineering FPOP.  Each one introduced me to MIT, Cambridge, Boston, and a new group of awesome friends, and I am so grateful for the opportunities! Preservation of the Frosh  Just a few logistics - you are a prefrosh right now, and the 2017s are frosh.  You will not be a frosh and the frosh will not be sophomores until President Reif goes on a giant stage and welcomes you, the Class of 2018, as the freshman class.  President Hockfield never welcomed the Class of 2015 because of bad weather. They are still freshman. This makes sense. The reason why this is how it is and the way it has always be done is because we want to have prefrosh for as long as possible, and there must always be a freshman class, and while sophomores become juniors and juniors become seniors and seniors become crufty, sophomores don't need to be conserved. Only you, the prefrosh or frosh of MIT, must be conserved. Take HASS Classes! Now into some academics - I'll briefly explain the HASS system here at MIT. You are required to take eight HASS - humanities, arts, and social sciences - classes during your time here at MIT.  Of those eight classes, you must take at least one humanities, one arts, and one social sciences class. You must also fulfill a HASS concentration, which involves taking 3-4 classes in a certain subject. For example, I plan on concentrating in writing poetry, which involves me taking a few poetry workshop classes and a reading poetry class. TAKE A HASS CLASS YOUR FIRST SEMESTER! Take at least one HASS class EACH semester!!  I have made this mistake twice and I cannot emphasize it enough.  Taking four (or five) technical classes is extremely difficult, and might drive you insane.  I understand that you might want to take all your required GIRs first semester since you are on Pass/No Record and don't want to have to worry about getting a good grade in these really difficult classes.  But this leads me to my next point... Pass/No Record is NOT an excuse to get a C- in every class You will hear "A=B=C=P," and it might be true when it comes down to a transcript, but it is not true when it comes to challenging yourself and figuring out what it takes to get an A in a class at MIT.  Aim high and try the hardest you can in your classes - the semester will be over more quickly than you know, and you will have to take graded classes based on the information you learned in your Pass/No Record classes.  If you didn't learn any information, then you really are going to be sad in the following semesters.  Use Pass/No Record to your advantage by seeing how much you can handle on your plate in addition to your classes.  Join a club sport or class council or rush a fraternity (and steal all their food and then come to East Campus)  and use this time to become close with the people around you.  Watch how you can allocate your time to still do well in your classes while being involved on campus, and make sure that you are not overcommitting to too much.  Pass/No Record is not an excuse to not try in your classes, but it is an excuse to go outside your comfort zone to figure out what it takes to live a balanced life at MIT.  People say "Social Life, Classes, Sleep - pick two." But you can have all three, even at a place with incredibly difficult and time-consuming classes like MIT. Classes to take your Freshman Year So you have to take a HASS class and you have to do your best in your classes - but what should those classes be?  I'm going to highlight the technical class options you have for your freshman year. All MIT students must complete a total of 17 General Institute Requirements, or GIRs.  It is possible to get out of some of these GIRs through AP credit or through passing an Advanced Standing Exam (ASE), which is basically like taking the final of the class right at the bat of the semester.  At any other time, the grade you get on an ASE would show up on your transcript. As a freshman on Pass/No Record, if you pass the ASE, you get a P! They have extended the offered biology classes from my year to include four different types of introductory classes that fulfill the biology requirement: 7.012, 7.013, 7014, and 7.016.  In the fall, you can take either 7.012 or 7.016. 7.013 and 7.014 are offered in the spring.  All of these classes cover the same fundamental principles of biochemistry, genetics, molecular and cell biology.  However, they each focus on a different one of these.   I recommend taking biology in the fall if you feel confident in your chemistry abilities, and in the spring if you do not.  I took biology at the same time as my chemistry class, and it did feel quite overwhelming at times.  Definitely try to split them apart so you can focus on them individually. Here at MIT, you are required to take single-variable (18.01) and multi-variable (18.02) calculus.  There are different versions of each that you can take, and my advice is to take the slightly harder version of whatever you feel comfortable with, that way you can drop down to a different version of the class if you decide that it is too difficult.  I would also recommend doing whichever track allows you to take 18.03, or differential equations, in the spring, although this might not be feasible for people who want to take 18.014 and 18.024, which are advanced classes that focus on calculus with theory.  18.03 is not a GIR (contrary to popular belief), but many, if not most, majors have it as a requirement.  It also is an extremely difficult and important class, and it is very necessary to have a strong math background before taking it. So if you ASE or AP out of 18.01, congratulations! Take 18.02 or 18.014. If you do not ASE or AP out of 18.01, taking 18.01 is fine, but consider taking 18.01A/18.02A.  This class involves a six-week review of single-variable claculus, and then 18.02 taken at the regular pace, which continues into IAP (Independent Activities Period during January).  Besides, if you start out taking 18.01A, it is perfectly fine and acceptable to drop down to 18.01 if it ends up being too difficult. Challenge yourself! Freshman year is all about discovering what your limits are - if 18.01A extends beyond your limits, that is okay! It does not mean you are any less smart than any of your peers or that you don't belong at MIT, it just means that maybe you weren't quite ready for that class. I am biased because I am course 3 (materials science and engineering), but TAKE 3.091!! Okay now I am going to be honest - you will have the option to take one of the following: 5.111, 5.112, or 3.091.  5.111 (pronounced five-eleven-one) is basic chemistry, with slightly more focus on liquid-state materials.  5.112 (pronounced five-eleven-two) is a bit more advanced version of 5.111, and covers additional materials that might help you if you plan on majoring in chemistry or becoming pre-med.  3.091 (pronounced three-oh-nine-one) focuses on solid-state materials, which I think are extremely interesting and I thought that the class was very well taught.  You might have heard rumors about 3.091 in the fall having no tests and, as a result, being quite disorganized and/or terrible.  However, this fall, 3.091 is going to be taught in the traditional way with tests (and hopefully no attendance grade) and small quizzes and the really great Professor Cima, and it will be an awesome class! Take it! Learn about phase diagrams and chocolate and materials! Yay materials! Yay polymers! The other day, I got a facebook message from the lovely Kimia Z. '18 asking about first semester physics, which is mechanics. She told me that her school has a very weak physics program, and she wanted to know if I would recommend she try to take classes over the summer. I told her that if you don't feel confident in your physics skills, I highly recommend taking 8.01L in the fall.  The class has the same content as 8.01, but it is taught over a longer period of time and in lecture style instead of in TEAL sessions, where you learn about a concept and immediately do a problem about it on whiteboards around the room in groups.  8.01L consists of the fall semester and IAP, and it was completely worth taking 8.01L for me and I felt a lot more confident about my physics skills moving at the slower pace than I would have in 8.01 TEAL. If you do feel uncomfortable with your physics background and want to take 8.01 anyway, that is perfectly fine, and again, you can always switch it to 8.01L later. And if you want to review concepts before classes start, MIT opencourseware is an amazing resource! The other requirement is 8.02, which is about electrical and magnetic properties in physics.  This is also taught in TEAL style, however, if you feel super confident in your physics abilities, you can choose to take 8.012 and 8.022 in the fall and spring respectively, which are advanced versions of each of the classes, taught in lecture style. Many of my friends on Tetazoo did this track, and they really enjoyed the classes and are now planning on double majoring in physics! Will L. '16 described the difference - "8.012 and 8.022 are good for showing what course 8 is like at MIT. 8.01 and 8.02 are more engineering classes." I mentioned the HASS requirement earlier, but in addition to taking 8 HASS classes, two of those classes must be communication intensive classes. Depending on if you get out of taking the FEE or if you pass it, you will either have to take a CI-H (communication intensive humanities class) or a CI-HW (communication intensive humanities writing class) your freshman year.  These classes involve writing a couple essays, writing a revision for one of those essays, and writing a big paper at the end. I don't like papers.  I took Bioethics (24.06) my freshman spring and it was okay. I'm doing anything I can to procrastinate taking another CI-H. Don't procrastinate!! The HASS classes are all listed on the internet with the other classes. That's all great... but when do I actually pick out my classes? In the fall! When you get here for your pre-orientation program, you are going to check into your temporary room in your temporary dorm, and you are going to spend many hours of many days at your FPOP having fun. After the final day of your FPOP, you will check in with your orientation leader.  (Quick note - Orientation activities are optional.)  This is the week that you will meet with your advisor and your associate advisor(s), and they will help you sort out your final schedule. It is nice to have some sort of plan on what you want to take, but that is not at all necessary.  You will very likely get the classes you want to take.  This leads me to my next point... Meet your Advising Team! Free food! Woo advising teams! I was an associate advisor this past year, and it was my duty, along with a faculty advisor, to help my advisees choose a path that was right for them. My advice to you is to keep in touch with your advising team - we are a great resource for you to reach out to in case of trouble with choosing classes or doing well in classes or life or anything else at all!  Come ask us questions! We will send you care packages and take you to get ice cream and more! As far as choosing freshman advising, there are two main options. You can choose advising that involves credit such as a learning community, or advising that offers no credit like traditional advising.  There is also residence based advising in some dorms, but, in my personal opinion, this system is a little unfair because it requires you to be stuck in your dorm for a full year, even if you decide that it is not the place for you.  Please keep this in mind when choosing which dorm you want to live in, because this can be a big commitment.  The dorms that have RBA are Maseeh, McCormick, Next House, Chocolate City, and Spanish House.  So if you know that these are the places that you want to live in forever and ever, go ahead! Put them as your first choice! But, be forewarned, if it turns out that the place isn't all you thought it was, you are stuck! (These are my opinions - there are many people who end up loving their dorm and the residence based advising programs!) I am a big fan of traditional advising, which just makes it so that your advisor is there for you when you need them, if you need them, and same with your associate advisor.  But all in all, your biggest source of information will be the upperclassmen on campus that you live with, work with, eat with, and are friends with. So come talk to us, we don't bite! And feel free to ask me questions anytime - comment below or come visit me during rush in East Campus! I'll dye your head a strange color! Or all the colors! Take Physical Education Classes EARLY. TAKE THE SWIM TEST! You just got here. It's day one of orientation, and you're signed up for the 12pm swim test.  But you're sleepy. You rather sleep. Sleep sleep sleep. GET UP! Go take the swim test! There are some people who wait until right before they graduate to take the swim test - don't do that! If you fail, you don't get to graduate from MIT. You have to wait another semester. Don't do that!!  If you don't feel comfortable swimming, that is okay! Take the swim physical education class right away! Don't save these required things for your senior year, because you only need to miss a few PE classes to fail one. Also, people will tell you that you need to complete the physical education requirement by your sophomore year. This is not true. Sometimes, you just cannot fit a PE class into your schedule - that is completely understandable. But try to spread out taking the classes, or at least a couple of the four required PE classes, during your freshman year while you have the time to do so.  And take the swim test! Do it!! Take advantage of REX! IT IS CPW ALL OVER AGAIN - BUT EVEN BETTER! Orientation - AKA Rush - is another time when we, the denizens of East Campus, as well as all other living groups around campus do everything in our/their power to convince you that our/their dorm is the best dorm and that you should live here/there!  I will post a lot of pictures in the fall of the awesome activities (including roller coaster building!) happening around East Campus, but do your best to visit every single dorm on campus, steal all the free food, and have a great time! Make new friends, build awesome things, eat great food, and have the time of your life before classes start and consume us all. I hope my little tidbits of advice are helpful!

And, of course, a... read more  see complete archives   Below is one of the robots I built for 2.007, MIT's extremely popular introductory design and manufacturing class:    For reference, here's the first "robot" I ever built, on the first day of 2.007:  Before I took 2.007, I hadn't ever used a mill or lathe.  I wasn't sure what it meant to tap a hole. Heck, I'd never used a power drill before.  But four months later, I was comfortable with all of these tools, thanks in large part to the awesome shop guys (particularly Bill and Tasker). I built my first gearbox and learned how to use fast fabrication methods.  And I built a pair of robots that actually did quite well in the competition!  It's been a lot of fun.  Here's a rough summary of the past few months: 2.007 is well known for its chaos and intensity, and it's intimidating to be told that by the end of this class you'll be building a Robot, capital 'R', and competing against your peers, many of whom have had years of FIRST robotics experience.  Suddenly you're faced with design decisions, big scary machine tools that you're not entirely comfortable turning on, part choices, and Arduinos, maybe even before you know what gears and bearings and linkages are. So what do you do?  Like any good engineer, break it up into smaller, more manageable pieces.  Our first assignment is to build a "Mini Me" robot that can drive around from a basic list of materials.  By the end of lab, I've bandsawed the glorified bent piece of plastic above and stuck 2 motors + an RC receiver on it.  It's not pretty, but it drives. At the end of lab, my (awesome) lab instructor Chip reminds us to always fasten our wheels, because loose wheels have tripped up many a top competitor before.  ~~~foreshadowing alert~~~ This year's robot competition is ski-themed - MITSKI! The instructors have build this cool course consisting of three different hills of different grades, with flags to pull, medals to collect, and trophies to pull.  Quickly it becomes apparent that the most efficient way to score points is to do laps on the extremely steep 60 degree top hill (in hindsight, I wish they had made flag pulling worth more points, as it would have led to more interesting robot mechanisms).  It's not a trivial problem to solve.  Because of the steepness of the hill, tipping is a problem.  Because of the slippery surface material, slipping is also a problem. As Richard Hammond from Top Gear tells us in a recorded video, "keep your centers of gravity low and your coefficients of friction high." For several days I iterate and iterate on a design (nicknamed "Spatula Bot") that tries to climb the steep hill by keeping my center of gravity extremely low.  It works, kind of; it's extremely slow up the slope, far too slow to have any hope of running multiple laps during the 120 second competition period.  Notice that I'm making extensive use of waterjetting sheet metal to make precise, elegant parts; thanks to my friend Emma S. '16 for her help waterjetting!  Amusingly, one of the robots on the final day is named "Flagrant Abuse of the Waterjet", a title that would have been accurate for my robots. Major credit goes to Josh B. '16, as he designs the first robot capable of quickly climbing the top hill, using a rail gripper.  His design ends up strongly influencing the rest of the field's hill climbers as well.  Here's a CAD of one of my early successful prototypes utilizing a "ski gripper", v2 of what eventually becomes my Ascensionist robot:  The RC controllers and Playstation controllers provided by 2.007 aren't terribly reliable or easy to use.  I decide early on to use my iPhone and iPad to control my robots via OSC, a wireless protocol usually used by DJs to connect to sound synthesizers.  This has the advantage of letting me avoid the bottleneck of waiting for available RC controllers later in the semester.  I briefly toy around with the idea of making a robot with large diameter wheels that drives equally well upside down, and build a few prototypes.  But the high speed motors I'm using don't have enough torque to drive the large wheels up the top hill, and I decide to revert to a strategy of building roll bars:  And this ends up being very similar to my final design; I also lower my entire chassis and use a 3D printed fixture to mount my motors.  Early on I discovered that tumbling down the top hill easily damages the delicate high speed motors I'm using.  My 3D printed mounts work well, and soon after lots of people are using them for their robots as well. As you can see from the propagation of Josh's rail gripper idea and my 3D printed motor mounts, ideas spread fast in 2.007.  That's the way it's designed: even though you're building your robot as an individual, especially for beginner builders it's essential to collaborate and work with other people.  Forget about "helping the competition"; working together and seeing what designs work (and just as important, which designs don't work) will save loads of time and lead to better robots for everyone. Plus, these are your peers, who you'll be working together with in 2.008, 2.009, and other team projects.  Don't burn your bridges by being petty and accusing people of "stealing" your general ideas.  This ain't Apple vs. Samsung. I've got my hill climbing robot mostly done, but I also want to build a robot that pulls down the multiplier.  But there's no way I'll be able to design, fabricate, and test an additional robot in 1 week.  Is there? One of the most underutilized resources in 2.007 (in my opinion) is a document called "How To Build Your Everything Really Really Fast".  It's written by Charles Guan, who now teaches the electric gokart special section of 2.007 (see, "it doesn't have to be a robot"), and goes into lots of fast fabrication techniques. Robust robot designs generally require a lot of right angles; with traditional fabrication techniques this can involve lots of milling and drilling precise holes.  But using waterjetting and fastener techniques like "t-nuts", you can save a lot of time and throw together fairly complicated robots quickly. A task that would have seemed impossible for me at the beginning of the semester, but thanks to Tasker and Steve (the shop guys in charge of the waterjet and lasercutter) I'm able to do it.  Here's the gearbox that eventually goes into the robot at the top of this page:  Note the extensive use of standoffs and t-nuts.  This makes my multiplier bot extremely modular; I'm able to completely disassemble and iterate my chassis and gearbox design in minutes, as opposed to hours.  Here's the final design of my 2 robots:  My hill climber robot scores enough points to seed me 2nd in the tournament (behind the aforementioned Josh), which means that I have a guaranteed spot on the final day of competition, and get to relax and watch the preliminaries. Then competition day comes, and it's totally awesome.  Besides the robots, there's this "Engineering Petting Zoo" showcasing cool machines from companies and students.  Among the stuff featured: Tony Stewart's NASCAR racecar, a Corvette, and electric gokarts built by the 2.007 alternate section. But the robots are the main attraction of the day, of course.  I'm able to cruise through the first few rounds of competition despite my hill climber flipping over, thanks to my multiplier bot.  Clockwise from top left: me controlling my hill climber via iPhone, Josh's hill climber + medal grabber bot, Danny (one of the lab instructors) and his Ski Patrol outfit, my multiplier bot in action.  Photo credits to Landon C. '17. But robustness is key, and one of my hill climber's wheels pops off in the final 8 round. I knew I should have listened to Chip and remembered to screw those wheels on.  An unfortunate time to learn that lesson, but I still have a lot of fun watching the final 4 duke it out. The final match, between Josh B. '16 and Clare Z. '16 proves to be especially exciting.  Josh's pair of autonomous robots has performed well all night and is capable of scoring well over 600 points - but Clare's manually controlled robot is crucially super robust and reliable.  In a huge upset, Josh's hill climber gets stuck in a rut, meaning his multiplier bot isn't able to push the trophy, and Clare wins with a score of 312.   Clare winning the gold trophy, next to Professor Sangbae Kim and Professor Amos Winter.  Photo credit to Landon C. '17. A thrilling end to the night, and a great way to cap off my favorite class at MIT so far.  I can't wait to take 2.008 and 2.009! Week 1: Spider-Man, Nina Yuen, and More! The concept is simple, users ask the question "What if x piece of history was different" and the more historically inclined Redditors construct an argument, with sources, about what would have happened. Here are a few of my favorite questions. "How would modern American football players fare in an ancient world?" "What if Afghanistan was never invaded by the United Front and the Taliban regime continued to conquer all of Afghanistan?" "What would allow the Roman Empire to last until today?"  A few months back I discovered the Geek And Sundry Youtube series of TableTop and I fell in love. Every week Wil Wheaton would gather a few of his celebrity friends and play a new Board/Card/Role-Playing game. The show was funny, the games were interesting, and it helped kindle a deep love of TableTop gaming. I burnt through all of the episodes in about a week or two and word on the street was that they were going to try to Crowdfund season 3. After a few weeks of doing just that, they've exceeded their goals and will be able to make 20 episodes and a Role-Playing Game show. I can't wait!   Net Neutrality is a topic that I've been closely following for a while now. The decision that the FCC makes will have a large impact on my future career and it's nice to see Youtubers spreading the word.  A few weeks back I started taking Complexity Theory and it has quickly risen through the ranks of my favorite classes this year. Every lecture has been better than the one before and the world of P vs. NP is slowly making sense. Apologies for breaking the Zaxxon rule with this one but it's been a while since a series of lectures was this interesting. Click HERE for a nice ELI10 of the problem.  After reading through The Name of the Wind/A Wise Man's Fear during Christmas break I started looking around for more fantasy books to fill my time and picked up The Blade Itself (Book 1 of The First Law trilogy). Whereas most of the books I loved before coming to MIT were Young Adult I decided to move to the more mature end of the spectrum. I've been reading The Blade Itself sporadically since December but it was becoming increasingly difficult to remember names or what's going on. So lately I've been waking up a little bit early to read every morning and I absolutely love the book.    And with that I'll finish asking you guys a simple question, what's making you happy this week? Trouble thinking up a good Kerberos username? Take some hints from Batman.                           Earlier this week, Morgan O. (G) invited MIT EMS and our campus police officers (who unfortunately could not attend) to see the place where she works - the roof of the Green Building!  The Green Building is the tallest building in Cambridge - 19 stories tall and on stilts at 277 feet!  She brought up her giant telescope and we looked at the moon, Mars, Jupiter and more! The view from the Green Building, the home of MIT's Earth and Planetary Scienes department, was absolutely gorgeous!  Lawrence W. (G) brought his really pretty camera and I brought mine, and we had some fun with them on the roof!   Adam S. '14 wanted a photo of him in front of the fanastic Boston skyline, and it wasn't long before everyone wanted their shot in front of the view!          In the end, we had a wonderful time, and we were all so glad that Morgan brought us up there to see Boston and Cambridge from a completely new perspective.  see complete archives  Today we're releasing our decisions regarding transfer applicants who applied for admission for Fall 2014. Transfer applicants, unlike freshman applicants, receive decisions via email from our office to the address listed on their application. The emails will be sent at 5 PM Eastern today, May 7, and you should receive it shortly thereafter, depending on the traffic in the tubes. Our transfer admissions process was quite competitive. As in past years, hundreds of students applied, and we only had space to admit fewer than 20 students. It is a difficult process: as usual, we are very excited about the students we have admitted, and often chagrined about those we could not. As a former transfer student myself, I know that this process can be a complicated one. For those of you who were admitted: welcome to MIT. For those who weren't: I wish you the best of luck. I transferred, but if I hadn't things would have been fine. Remember, college is mostly what you make of it, here or anywhere else; if you weren't one of those students whom we admitted, I wish you the best of luck wherever you go (or stay).  You: Where are you from?Me: London.You: But you...you don't...you don't seem to have a British accent.Me: Correct. Let me explain!

To be fair, hes a name rather than a face for most of us: the PhD physicist-turned-politician, one of two physicists in Congress, now the US Representative for New Jerseys 12th congressional district. I happen to know what he looks like because an assistant addressed him by name when I passed by in the hallway.  Now, Im in a big room scarfing down bacon and coffee with over a hundred other representatives from science and engineering organizations, waiting for Rep. Holt to give a speech. And now that the Congressman is physically in the room, the internal conflict begins. I think, I will probably never have the chance to meet Rush Holt ever again. Then I think, I have nothing to say to Rush Holt, and he probably doesnt have anything to say to me since Im not one of his constituents, and the last time I was in New Jersey I was repulsed by the smell of industrial fumes along the New Jersey Turnpike. Finally, I gather my wits and conclude, Who cares? So, I walk over to where Rush Holt is standing. Well, actually, I walk up to Rep Holts staffer (Sean) and thank him for giving such a helpful presentation at the AAAS yesterday. While Sean and I are talking, Congressman Holt walks up to me. Rush Holt: Hi, Im Rush Holt.Um, no kidding. Me: Im Anna Ho. Im an undergraduate at MIT majoring in physics.Rush Holt: Physics!Me: Yes, I gather that we have something in common!Oh, dear. Someone sound the socially awkward alarm.Rush Holt: Who do you work with at MIT?Is Rush Holt intimately familiar with MITs physics department...? I give him a few names. He asks where Im from and what my research is about. We talk about pulsars, and at some point Rush Holt says "yes, I know what pulsars are. I'm a physicist!" At this point, a number of people are trying to get Rep. Holts attention, to tell him that its speech time. I excuse myself and go sit with the rest of the American Astronomical Society delegation, as the Congressman heads to the podium.  I miss his first few sentences, because I'm busy wondering how many people can say that they've talked to a Congressman about pulsars. *     *     * The United States House of Representatives occupies three office buildings along Independence Avenue. Breakfast with Rush Holt took place in one of them. We arrived there at 7:30am and waited in a long line to walk through metal detectors. The nice view of the Capitol Building nearly made up for the fact that it was FREEZING outside (Dear Washington DC: that was a pitiful excuse for Spring.)  Ive been on Capitol Hill for two days. Two days were enough to learn that things here unfold on VERY SHORT TIMESCALES. Yesterday, for example, we learned about a proposal to raise the FY 2015 NSF (National Science Foundation) budget from $7.25 billion to $7.5 billion. We were encouraged to urge our representatives to sign onto this letter. In order to urge intelligently, we had to memorize the following: its a Dear Colleague letter addressed to Chairman Frank Wolf and ranking member Chaka Fattah of the House CJS Appropriations Subcommittee, Congressman Butterfields office is leading the letter, the staff contact is Dennis Sills, and the deadline for signing is 1pm March 27. We are meeting with our representatives today, and March 27 is tomorrow. My team is comprised of myself, a graduate student from Georgia Tech, and an astronomer from the Harvard-Smithsonian Institute for Astrophysics. This is our schedule for the day: 9:00 AM Representative Katherine Clark (Massachusetts)10:00 AM Representative John Lewis (Georgia)10:30 AM Representative Michael Capuano (Massachusetts)- lunch, presumably -1:00 PM Senator Elizabeth Warren (Massachusetts)1:30 PM Senator Saxby Chambliss (Georgia)2:00 PM Senator Ed Markey (Massachusetts)2:30 PM Senator Johnny Isakson (Georgia) Im in charge of the meetings with Representative Capuano and Senator Markey. I secured our appointments through a combination of e-mail exchanges and embarrassing phone conversations. Now, its 8:30am and time to find Rep Clarks office. I hyperventilate a little bit and skim my notes from yesterday. My name is Anna Ho, and Im a constituent living in Cambridge. Im a senior at MIT majoring in physics, but today Im here representing the American Astronomical Society. In the fall, Im going to start a PhD program in astronomy  but when I started college, I didnt think that I was cut out to be a research scientist. The summer after my sophomore year, I did an internship funded by the National Science Foundation. I loved it so much that I went back the next summer and did it again. I learned that I wanted to do research because I had the opportunity to try doing research. And I had that opportunity because of this program. I became a scientist because of this program, and I would be very happy to tell you more about it.  *     *     * You can learn a lot about a politician by looking around his office. For example, Representative John Lewis was one of the leaders of the African-American Civil Rights Movement, and you could probably piece this together from the shelves full of awards and medals. A Martin Luther King Jr. Dr. sign hangs over one of the big wooden doors, with the following quote: Public officers are the trustees and servants of the people who are at all times amenable to them. There are Coca Cola bottles everywhere. We had a similar experience in Senator Chamblisss office later in the afternoon; apparently this is a Georgia Thing. Another Georgia Thing is peanuts. Peanut bowls in both offices prompted my Georgia Tech teammate to exclaim Georgia peanuts! Similarly, stepping into Representative Capuanos office feels  at least, to this Massachusetts resident  bizarrely like stepping into a museum of home. The first thing I notice is an MIT flag on the wall, dangling with flags from all of District 7s many universities and colleges. The tables are covered with editions of the New England Journal of Medicine and local newspapers. On the wall is a picture of Jordan Hall, where I once went to watch Davie 12 sing Mendelssohns oratorio Elijah, as well as a plaque about Reach Out, an organization I volunteered with as an MIT freshman. Senator Markeys office is less home-y, so while waiting for our meeting to start I sit on the long dark red couch and stare at framed pictures: over the fireplace, Markey with Obama and Markey with Ted Kennedy, on a table to my right, Markey with Obama and Nancy Pelosi, and by the door, an aerial picture of Boston and the Charles, MIT just out of sight. *     *     * We meet with Representatives in the morning, eat lunch, then meet with Senators in the afternoon. We stand up when the staffer enters, shake hands, introduce ourselves, sit around a table. When its my turn to lead the meeting, I tell the staffer about NSF-funded research internships for undergraduates (REUs), and how having the opportunity to do science research over the summer is what made me decide to go into science research as a career. Nicole (from Georgia Tech) chimes in to say that she did an REU as an undergraduate as well, and that its also what inspired her to continue in science. Kelly (from Harvard-Smithsonian) then explains that she did an REU as an undergraduate and now runs a Solar Physics REU. I emphasize that NSF funding is crucial not just for building telescope facilities and paying researchers, but also for maintaining these important educational programs. Rep. Capuanos staffer is very interested; he pulls out a notebook, writes down the name of the program, takes notes on what were saying. He tells us that Capuanos office is totally on board with all this science funding stuff, that theyve already signed onto the NSF Dear Colleague letter, that having anecdotes like this from us is very helpful as they try to convince others to do the same. In between meetings and on the way to lunch, we walk through underground tunnels and keep an eye out for Congressmen, who are identifiable by the pins they wear. We run into Michele Bachmann while waiting for an elevator and catch a glimpse of Ted Cruz. We split up after lunch and I head over alone to the Senate building. Theres a long line inside the Senate Cafe; I sit at a table holding Paradise Lost, watching white shirts and pastel-colored ties flash by. The cafe is full of handshakes and sandwiches are tossed into paper boxes. No one seems to have time to sit and eat. And now, the Senate meetings. Turns out that Elizabeth Warren is holding a meet-and-greet:  That afternoon, there is only one moment that (initially) feels like a disaster. We're sitting with Sen. Markeys staffer, Dan, and I'm running the meeting. Dan has a PhD in physics and worked at the LHC for a while, and makes it clear from the start that his office is already on board. My brain says you have an action item! and my mouth starts moving on autopilot: My Mouth: Has Sen. Markey signed onto the Dear Colleague letter circulating in the House?Dan: ...Well, thats in the House, and were the Senate.My Brain: NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO WHY ANNA WHY Thinking quickly,Me: Well, is there an equivalent letter in the Senate?Dan: No, but I would be happy to start one. Wait, what? Dan: Its really helpful when scientists come in and give concrete suggestions for legislation they want to see. Wait, you want us to do that? Does anybody realize this? Does anybody understand the system well enough to even know what to ask for? Dan asks us to e-mail him the House letter. Still in shock, I offer my contact information as usual. Dan says that he will actually be in Cambridge in a few weeks, and would be happy to take me up on the offer of an MIT tour. A week later, Josh Shiode e-mails the AAS delegation saying Thanks to one of our teams, Senator Markeys office is leading a Dear Colleague letter in the Senate that closely mirrors the one in the House in support of $7.5 billion for NSF in FY 2015. Please send the below text and attached pdf to each of your Senate contacts and urge them to sign on to support this effort. A couple of days later, Dan e-mails me to say that the letter is circulating and 11 senators have signed on so far. Thought youd like to know! A week after that, I meet Dan in MIT's Lobby 7. Hansol '15 gives us a tour of Prof. Brad Pentelute's chemistry lab and two graduate students show us around the Man-Vehicle Lab. Between labs (getting around MIT involves a lot of walking) Dan and I discuss how to get scientists more involved in advocacy, and what a scientist's role in advocacy is in the first place. Eventually, Dan has to go get work done so I drop him off at the Stata Center. We shake hands, and I say that I'll be in touch. I mean it.  The first speech I ever gave in my life was to the 1000 of you who attended the CPW Welcome event Thursday night. It was a 5 minute, 5 step guide on "How to Do CPW", and I heard it was "amusing" though I was really going for inspirational and life-changing. Here's a gif in case you missed it:  At the time, I actually didnt know that there was a major difference since my CPW: THE EVENTS DIDNT GO PAST 2 AM. At least not officially. Come on MIT, what is that? Its breaking tradition to not have events registered around the clock. It made enough people upset that prefrosh might potentially get too much sleep, that I think its reverting back to a 24/7 schedule next year.   During CPW, there were little stations installed where you could fold cranes from white paper. I noticed them filling up over the weekend, though I didnt take a closer look. The end result? A HACK!! It was raised from the ceiling of Stata the night before the one-year memorial of Officer Sean Collier. It was such a stunning and poignant tribute that some people didn't realize it was a hack. I really commend those who put it together.  Then came Ring Delivery, which was the day after I went to an Iggy Azalea concert. Honestly, freshman year, I wasn't particularly interested in the brass rat. I thought "I don't like wearing jewelry, and anyway, it's expensive." Ive changed my mind since then, and think it is a genuinely special object due to its symbolism. As for the finances, I heard RingComm had funds left over that they were turning into subsidies for students. This was already demonstrated at Ring Premiere, because the first person in line won a free ring (hint for future years!). So as the rumor went, you had to get in line early for ring sales to get a subsidy. Therefore, Cara L. and I woke up at 6:30 am on a Saturday to get in line for 10 am sales: we were the 6th and 7th people in line! Turns out we didnt need to be so early because the first 100 students got $100 off. No regrets, because for the 3 hours I was in line I was technically making $33.33 an hour, whoot whoot.  Obligatory photo compilation:  Kara P., Yami P., Anna L., and Justin C. This semester, I moved out of East Campus (after moving out of Baker) and into Simmons Hall (where blogger legendary Elizabeth C. '13 lived). You can see the new Simmons 2014 i3 video here. I live in C-Tower, and have pretty much a penthouse view of the Charles. I really love my section, and what's not to love when we were the Scooter Hockey Champions of the first annual simmons competition last week, whazam! Decked out with our retro-neon-game-faces, we scootered our way to viCTory.   Garrett S. '17, Andres A. '17, Evan D. '17, Nick M. '17, Nadia M. '17, Alex D. '17, Sean K. '14,  Christina S. '14, Cosmos D. '15, Hesham '15, and Alison O. (GRT) As a final update, on Friday, Fossil Free MIT revealed a campus-wide statement called the "Blue Line." From their website, it states:  Fossil Free MIT gained permission from MIT Facilities before executing this, and will be removing the tape today. However, this project seemed to gain mixed response from MIT's population, as well as reddit's, which claims: "I'm not sure if wrapping the campus in a petroleum product is the best way to get this message across." I'll update if there is more news soon. This past Friday was the nth annual Tetazoo faculty dinner -  a great event filled with our favorite foods, faculty, staff, random graduate students, and friends! This year we had over 16 different faculty and staff from across MIT, including our very own Chris Peterson!  We decorated the lounge for the occasion, and we spent the whole day cooking in the kitchen preparing food for our favorite professors and instructors!            Pictures of Food                 Baby Marie Our most honored guest was the 1 1/2 year-old baby Marie, the child of our GRTs (Graduate Resident Tutors) who live on our hall.  She got special privileges such as first dibs on food and a special seat outside of the GRT apartment.   The Faculty  Once the faculty started to arrive, we had a greeter at the door to welcome them to our hall.  Most of us were dressed in our hall shirts, featuring our hall mascot, the Squanch!   And we had a special occasion! It was Professor Ron Roscoe's 75th birthday - and he spent it on Tetazoo! We were honored, and Kayla E. '15 made him a beautiful birthday cake, decorated in circuits. We all sang - normally :O - and I think he really enjoyed our celebration and the cake!   And Chris Peterson was there!! I invited him to hang out with the crazy kids he admitted, and I think he had a really good time! Unfortunately, he didn't get to eat any Angel Food Cake. He only got to look at six pieces.    But Petey hated the cats since he is allergic and thinks they are terrible. HOW CAN YOU HATE THIS FACE, PETEY!?  All in all, the nth annual Tetazoo Faculty Dinner event was a huge success, and now we have enough leftovers to last us weeks! Yay not going hungry! After rocking the jeans + sweater/t-shirt look for almost an entire school year, two events occurred last Thursday and Friday that required a slightly more spiffy outfit choice: Ring Delivery (also blogged by Rachel) and the end-of-season fencing banquet. Here are some thoughts if youre into that kind of thing.  The Photography of Ring Delivery: Ridiculous Poses and Pictures of HandsA data summary-esque analysis by Ceri AbstractRing Delivery is a time-honored tradition in which Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) students gather to receive small chunks of molded, semi-precious or precious metal for which they paid large sums of money several months prior. After receiving their ring, colloquially called a Brass Rat, individuals usually feel pride, joy, and a slight sense of dread (or perhaps elation) because they are nearing the end of their sophomore year and the halfway point of their MIT career. This peculiar brew of emotions leads individuals to document their experience in odd ways, especially through very distinct poses and photographs. As such, this study will analyze primary examples of these photographs and attempt to elucidate why such great effort is put into emphasizing the presence of a new piece of jewelry.Materials and MethodsAll photographs were donated by Rachel R. 16. Accompanying figures were digitized using an iPhone 4 camera and created using a Pentel mechanical pencil, an ultra fine point Sharpie marker, and a Tombow N79 brush pen. Results and Figures   Figure 1. Participants pledge allegiance to MIT. This photograph depicts the most common group pose found at Ring Premiere, in which several people smile and hold their ring-bearing hands with flat palms over their chest area. Pictured here are myself, Rachel R. 16, Lauren W. 16, and Nick A. 16, aka two-thirds of the coolest suite to ever have existed (an unbiased assessment). While almost everyone participates in a Ring Premiere photograph of this genre, this may also be the most ridiculous picture from a non-MIT perspective. Clearly the intent of participants is to appear excited for the new status symbols upon their fingers, but each Brass Rat is reduced to but a small glimmer. Participants take a traditional stance with their right hand over the heart region and appear to be pledging allegiance to MIT, a beaver, engineering, IHTFP, stress, Tim the beaver, symbolism, materialism, or some other unknown force. Further study is required to identify to what or to whom they are pledging.   Figure 2. A superhero resides within every MIT student. While a slightly less common pose, oftentimes with smaller groups of 2-3 individuals, this photograph depicts students displaying their rings with clenched fists. Students may smile, as in this example with Alex O. 16 and Rachel R. 16., or adopt a scowl or more serious facial expression to amplify intensity. This genre of picture represents the inner desire to be a superhero within all MIT students. While many would say that these pictures parallel the heroic nature of Tony Stark/Iron Man, MITs celebrity comic book hero, the presence of the Brass Rat in lieu of an arc reactor seems to invoke imagery of the Wonder Twins. The Wonder Twins powers were invoked by forming contact between their rings, at which point Zan (the male) would be able to assume any form of water, and Jayna (the female) would be able to transform into any animal. Perhaps MIT students hope that their rings will bestow similar powers, like knowledge or the ability to transform into an oversized beaver.   Figure 3. Students comMIT to an engagement with a university. This type of photograph is designed to emphasize the details of both the Brass Rat and/or the manicures of the student, as depicted by the hands of Rachel R. '16 and Lesley W. '16. In a similar vein are the pictures of the MIT ring box with the Brass Rat nestled inside; not pictured here. The most common caption to these photographs is some variation on MIT finally put a ring on it, or Engaged to the institute! While this quip is in reference to the fact that most people wear Brass Rats on their right hand ring finger, participants do not appear to consider the extent of this metaphor. Perhaps it is an acknowledgement that life at MIT is like a rocky marriagethe first part of freshman year is the honeymoon phase, but then students end up living in the academic buildings and sleeping on couches, raising stress levels, and investing large sums of money to make the university happy. Eventually, this engagement will end in a divorce, when these students graduate and move on with their lives as a new batch of hopefuls fill their place. Discussion and ConclusionsThrough this study, we have discovered that MIT students are proud of their quest to survive their undergraduate career, and this pride manifests itself in the form of strange photographs upon receiving a status symbol of attending the aforementioned institution. While strange to an outsider, these photographs appear annually on MIT students social media websites around the last week of April. This tradition will most likely continue as long as Brass Rats are being distributed at a Ring Delivery, which, in all predictions, may be many centuries to come. On a separate (totally not giving you whiplash) note, the day immediately following Ring Delivery was the first chance for the fencing sophomores to show off their new rings at a different formal-ish event, the end of the year fencing banquet. To my knowledge, a lot of sports teams have some form of our-seasons-over-but-we-should-eat-food-or-something-because-you-guys-are-cool type event, and this is the fencing teams version. There is food, merriment, gifts for graduating seniors, special award nominations (for example, the Anne Zabladoff Award for Fencing Masochism or most Clueless Sophomore), and paper plate awards for everyone involved with the team. I dont have any particularly snarky commentary re: photos taken at this event, so here are a couple courtesy of Sherry R. 15. Theres a group photo of the entire team + coaches, the (almost entire) foil squad, 5/6 of womens foil (self-proclaimed highest attendance, lowest attention span), and mens foil making fun of womens foil (plus a rogue mens sabre).         As exams become more and more of a reality that I can't ignore, I find my weekly/fortnightly blogs slowly phasing themselves out. As such I thought I'd steal a simple format from the wonderful NPR podcast Pop Culture Happy Hour and just tell you guys a few things that made me happy this week. The rules are simple, what I post needs to be something that you can also enjoy (called the Zaxxon Rule) and the post shan't be too long.  I was lucky enough to see this movie on April 12th(I realize this was a few weeks ago but it's still making me happy), thanks to the early UK release date, and I absolutely loved it. A huge fan of the original three movies (yes, even the third one)  Spider-Man 2 was always one of my favorite movies and this movie knocked it of its throne. While I still feel like Tobey Maguire plays the better Peter Parker, Andrew Garfield has Spider-Man on lock.  A few weeks back my future boss sent me a few books to check out before I started my internship. Sceptical about the title for this one I put off reading it and spent my free time catching up on a few fantasy books. After finishing The Wise Man's Fear I decided to pick it up and enjoy the beautiful Spring weather. What I found was a wonderful book filled with useful tips and dozens of anecdotes of when these simple steps made a big difference in how a few greats, such as Lincoln, Roosevelt and Andrew Carnegie, ran the country and their businesses. This is a must read for anyone who going into an internship this summer.  When Ernesto '15 and I visited Amsterdam a few weeks back one of our stops was at the de Appel Arts Centre where we found a wonderful exhibition about the artist Nina Yuen. I can't put my finger on what it is about the videos but we sat there and patiently watched all 40+ minutes in a trance. The video above, Heather Who, was my favorite of the bunch.  Sarah Kay is without a doubt one of my favorite spoken word poets and her new poem Ghost Ship is a great example why.   And with that I'll finish with asking you guys a simple question, what's making you happy this week? The college admissions process is often compared to dating. It's a dance that happens between students and colleges where the power dynamic shifts back and forth several times; one courts the other, then the other courts the first, and so on. We spend time and money trying to identify the right students who could be great candidates for our institutions, and do all kinds of outreach--traveling the country, visiting high schools, giving presentations, campus tours, sending brochures and emails...all in hopes that they'll apply to our school. We wait in anticipation to see the applications roll in. Students enter into the application process, picking and choosing which colleges they want to apply to. For those whom we are lucky enough to receive their applications, we read them, learn about their lives, fall in love with many, but can only choose a few. Applicants wait with bated breath to hear back, nervous and anxious, constantly hitting refresh to find out their decision. The tables turn again--once we've admitted a class of students, we begin to court them once more. Shiny tubes, greeting cards, and a four-day extravaganza called Campus Preview Weekend. Now it's our turn to wait, excited and eager, hoping the applicants we love so much will say "yes" in return. And that brings us to today. Many have said yes; welcome to the family! Some have said no; we'll eat a couple pints of ice cream, and all will be okay. But then there are others who haven't said anything yet... If you were admitted to a college, I'm sure you can remember what it was like, constantly hitting refresh, and waiting in anticipation to hear responses from the college(s) you applied to. For the last several weeks, we've now been doing the same. Every day, hitting refresh, waiting to hear back from the 1,419 students we extended admission offers to. (If you think waiting for a handful of college decisions is stressful, try waiting for 1,419 replies.) The deadline has come and gone, and for those of you who haven't responded yet (who haven't been granted extensions for financial aid reasons), I'm guessing most of you have decided to go to another place. That's perfectly fine--we completely understand. There are tons of amazing schools out there, and we know you've made a choice that is right for you. The only thing we ask in return, is that you please let us know. Log in to your MyMIT account, and click on "How to accept or decline our offer of admission", and complete the form. I know breaking up is hard to do, but not knowing is even worse. Plus, it doesn't have to be goodbye forever--we can still be friends...and there's always grad school. :) Thanks for dancing with us, and we look forward to hearing from you soon. P.S. This applies to pretty much every college out there, so if you have other schools you haven't responded to yet, do that too! P.P.S. For those on the waitlist, we haven't forgotten about you either! As you can see above, we empathize with the pain of waiting and not knowing, and want to get back to you as quickly as possible. More news to come soon, I promise.  It's May 1st. Most of your friends have decided where they are going to college in the fall and can sleep soundly.  But making a choice is a little harder for your situation. You may be overwhelmed thinking about prices, distance from home, community, and/or ability to perform well at MIT.      First of all, please     and let's review a few common questions you may have about enrolling at MIT.   1. Are there normal people there?/Are 'my kind of people' at MIT? With 457 different student groups, different dorm personalities and the insane amount of activities happening regularly, the short answer is yes. If you don't want to take my word for it, comment with your must-have interest and I'll look into it.   (This is an activities bulletin board outside my office).   2. I don't think I can handle the curriculum at MIT. Don't let imposter syndome win! We accepted you because we know that you can have a successful MIT career. Here are some wise words from Mikey, our director of selection, who has experienced the same doubts. If you're still worried, there are services available to help you succeed and you'll have a faculty or staff advisor who can help guide you during your four years at the 'tute.   3. I don't think my parents and I can afford MIT. We know that the cost of MIT factors into most students decision processes. Members of the Student Financial Services staff are available to you to answer any remaining questions that might be lingering for you or your family.   Remember that the value of MIT is worth more than the price of the education. Youll be a part of a unique community of problem-solvers receiving a hands-on education that provides opportunities for undergrad research, internship opportunities, and study abroad experiences. ^_^    4. How do I enroll? Log in to your myMIT account and select "I will enroll at MIT for the term beginning September, 2014.*" (There are other options, but you're on your own there.) That's it! No deposit required.  If you think about these questions and decide MIT is not the place for you, we thank you for letting us get to know you this year and wish you the best...    Are there other questions you have about enrolling? I'll be around answering them until 11:59 PM EST tonight to help you make your decision!  In just four short weeks, my time as a MIT freshman will draw to a close. Boxes will be packed, old psets that I will probably never look at again will be thrown away, and students will be scattering across the world for the three months we call summer break. Ive had the opportunity to try so many new and wildly amazing experiences here, some of which Ive recorded in the semi-permanent realm of the blogosphere (who are we kidding, the internet is forever), and I look forward to the ones Ill have in the future. Finals week will mark the end of an era and slowly, one by one, people will leave for internships, MISTI, vacations, or whatever else piques their interest. But its not really goodbye. After all, we have the consolation of knowing that come fall semester, we will all be returning to the familiar rhythm of psets, friends, and free food. Of course, the nature of college renders that last statement faulty in one regard: not all of us will be returning. The new semester marks not only the exciting arrival of the class of 2018, but also the bittersweet departure of the class of 2014. On one hand, we are proud of their accomplishments and wish them only the best in whatever future lies before them. On the other hand, there will always be a whatever-shape-awesome-people-are shaped hole in all of our hearts. Friday was the varsity tennis teams last home game of the year and, consequently, Senior Day, a day to celebrate the seniors and all that theyve accomplished. This year we had two graduating seniors, Lauren and Julia, and we were determined to make it one of the greatest senior days ever. Here is a recipe that I have recorded for posterity: Ingredients: 1 tray of brownie-cookie-dough-Oreo hybrid dessert2 meticulously designed photo collages (Alana 16 is a wizard at making collages)1 pack of goofy 2014 glittery new years paper glasses, courtesy of the internet2 colorful posters for maximum cheering1 heartfelt coaches speech1 instrumental version of Bruno Mars Treasure to sing along with Directions: Prepare the ingredients in the secrecy of someones dorm room, preferably in the company of your fellow teammates. Secretly eat some of the Oreos before they get baked. Begin senior day with heartfelt speeches and gifts from the coaches, followed by a presentation of the team gifts. Ensure that everyone is wearing their goofy glasses and end the mini ceremony with an impeccable (coughcough) group rendition of Treasure, complete with (questionable) choreography and rhythmic mumbling when the revised lyrics are forgotten. Win the match and celebrate the final home game of the season. Makes 1 serving. I started playing tennis when I was 8 years old at my local community park, the majority of my time on the court spent running around in circles and laughing with my friends. At the time, the mechanics of the sport were second in importance to the excitement of the games and youthful camaraderie. As I got older, practices became focused and I began to compete in individual tournaments. I made some amazing friends while travelling to national tournaments around the country, but tennis became more and more of an individual sport and the hours spent running around in circles with friends turned into hours of drills, conditioning, and matches. I loved playing tennis though, so I never really noticed the solitude of an individual sport until high school when I joined the tennis team and rediscovered the same camaraderie that I had had when I was 8. At MIT, as a part of the varsity tennis team, Im happy to say that Ive found the same thing here: a second family. Everyone brings something unique and amazing to the team and I cant imagine it being any other way. Of course, this solidarity is partly an inevitable byproduct of the amount of time that we spend together each week on and off the court.  The team huddles together to celebrate the last home match of the season. I think there might also be a sandwich on the ground. I'm not sure. Like many other fall sports, we started pre-season practice a week before classes started, breaking in new tennis balls while freshman orientation was in full swing. Practice is a daily affair from 5:15-7pm and we have matches virtually every weekend, some at home and a rare few a couple of hours away by bus. Only weeks ago, during our spring season, we played a match at Vassar College in New York and spent the four hour bus ride back playing road trip games and trying not to lose our sanity (though we did discover an appalling lack of desserts that start with the letter E). There is certainly a substantial time commitment that comes with being a student-athlete, one that becomes particularly noticeable when you find yourself staring at the fascinating patterns on the back of the bus seats instead of attending one of the countless events that usually take place on a fine Saturday night. But thankfully, my professors and TAs have been very understanding whenever I have had to skip class for tennis so the only problem I face is finding the time to catch up on the material I have missed. Being a part of the team has solidified my belief that while some things can be done alone, it doesnt mean they have to be; having your friends and team mates around to support you makes things infinitely better. Its like the difference between eating a piece of bread and eating a piece of bread with peanut butter, Nutella, and bananas cheering you on. Unless youre allergic to peanut butter, in which case that was probably a really bad analogy. Our season wraps up with NCAA regionals next weekend and while Friday was the last home match, next weekend could be our last match of the school year. Well be saying goodbye to daily practices, to bumpy bus rides, and to blurry pictures of my friends lecture notes from the classes Ive missed. Most importantly, well be saying goodbye to the seniors. I know Ive only gotten to know them for a year, but its been such a year of unforgettable moments. Next year Ill be a sophomore and the cycle will begin again: new faces, new friends, new family, and the fond memory of all the seniors that have come before. Thankfully, underneath all this change, the joy of the sport and the friendships formed will always be constant. Ive been playing tennis for eleven years now and I dont plan on stopping any time soon. In the future, if you ever see an eighty year old lady running around in circles on a tennis court and laughing with other similarly aged yet surprisingly spry senior citizens, its probably me, rediscovering the same happiness that I had when I was 8 and that I have right now.  You: Where are you from?Me: London.You: But you...you don't...you don't seem to have a British accent.Me: Correct. Let me explain! I was born in Singapore, had a Singaporean accent, then moved to London during the summer before fifth... read more  see complete archives  Books wrote our life story, and as they accumulated on our shelves (and on our windowsills, and underneath our sofa, and on top of our refrigerator), they became chapters in it themselves. How could it be otherwise?     -Anne Fadiman, in the preface to her essay collection Ex Libris * * * There are 37 days before graduation, so I decided that Room Cleaning must begin. I started with my bookshelf, since that seems to be where clutter ultimately accumulates. I unfolded a cardboard box, switched on my desk lamp, and sat down cross-legged on the carpet. I pulled out loose papers. What if I need those vector calculus equation sheets in six years?! Anna, you have them now and you still look everything up on Google. Recycling bin. What if, in ten years, getting a job hinges on having my notes from organic chemistry lecture freshman spring?!? Um, right. Recycling bin.  At some point, I took a break to refill my mug, pausing on my way out the door to switch off the desk lamp. One night during the summer before tenth grade, I put a similar lamp and mug on the floor of a dorm room closet at Franklin & Marshall College. I dutifully turned off the room lights (my summer camp had a strict lights-out policy) then crawled into the closet, pulled the doors shut behind me, and read the newly-released Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows from cover-to-cover while crouching underneath my t-shirts. When I shut the book, I cried. That series had been a steady companion. * * * First into the cardboard box were the books I forgot I owned, followed by the books I had no intention of revisiting. Three categories of books survived the cull: used  but still useful  textbooks, books I havent yet read but am eager to read, and books I regard as old friends. The first category includes Shankar's Principles of Quantum Mechanics and the second includes Le Morte dArthur and The Silmarillion by J.R.R. Tolkien (I owe Prof. Bahr for much of my current reading list.) The third category fills a half-shelf that I would gladly haul across the globe. On the far left is Platos Gorgias. There is a convoluted flowchart opposite the inside cover, in some previous iteration of my handwriting. Callicles points to pleasure and Socrates points to "happiness." Pleasure and happiness are boxed and connected, and labeled Callicles mistakenly assumes that they are the same. There is an arrow from happiness to orderliness, and another from orderliness to cosmic order. On the top of page 105 I wrote what is the ultimate goal of the good life? and on the very last page I underlined to such a degree of lack of education have we come! I read Gorgias in 11th grade, in a semester elective called Early Classical Thought. Mr. Potchatek stood at the window gazing at passers-by while we students sat around an oval table and grappled valiantly with the following question: what the heck is Socrates talking about? I could tell that Mr. Potchatek was listening intently because every now and then our conversation made him smile or frown, and occasionally he wandered over to pose new questions that stunned us all into silence. He never answered his own questions; he let us sit in silence until one of us answered. One day, at the end of class, he told me that the text was still confusing him. He handed me a board marker and asked for my help. I got up at the board while he sat on the table, and together we drew a flowchart that I very happily copied into my copy of Gorgias. Sometimes, when the psets are getting me down and I need a boost, I peek at that flow chart and remember how that moment felt. * * * In July, my annotated Gorgias will travel with me to Marburg, Germany, for an intensive German language course. Then well head south to Heidelberg, and Gorgias will live in my new apartment for a year while I commute to and from the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy. My research question is how did the Milky Way form? and my approach will be to measure and calculate the ages of stars and watch the process unfold. I decided to try out astronomy research during my sophomore year at MIT, partly because I was captivated by a book called First Light. First Light resides two books away from Gorgias, separated by The Language of God by Francis Collins (a gift from a friend as part of our ongoing discussion about whether religion can be reconciled with science) and The Invention of Love by Tom Stoppard (which I read in Prof. Diana Hendersons wonderful Studies in Drama course at MIT). First Light was written by Richard Preston, a science writer who spent many months with a group of astronomers, like (in his own words) Jane Goodall among the chimpanzees. The book is an intimate portrait of obsession: of the kind of person who can be an astronomer, of marching to the slow pace of scientific progress, of the persistence required for discovery. Exaclty how this came to pass is a long story and I'll skip it here, but Preston autographed and mailed me this copy of the book, writing: For Anna Ho, Good luck in all your adventures  keep looking up.  One of the main characters in First Light is Jim Gunn. Preston describes him as a professor at Princeton University overflowing with awards and prizes, but most comfortable in a brown sweater drilled with moth holes and glasses padded around the nose with a wad of electrical tape. I met Jim Gunn a little over a month ago. Actually, its probably more accurate to say that I hunted Jim Gunn down, a little more than a month ago. I was on a graduate school visit and asked Prof. Jill Knapp (his wife) where he was. She led me down to the basement, explaining that he hides behind the vacuum tube. Knock, knock. Jim? Jim Gunn peeked out from behind the metal monstrosity. This is Anna Ho. Shes on a graduate school visit and wants to meet you. And just like that, I was sitting with Jim Gunn behind an enormous vacuum tube. I asked what it was used for, and he said that its not used for anything and its just too big to get out of the room. We spent the next twenty minutes chatting about First Light, what good science writing is, our favorite science fiction authors, and the importance of having breadth as a scientist. Finally, I asked him for his signature and now best of everything! Jim Gunn is taped next to Prestons note.  * * * Much of First Light takes place at Caltechs Palomar Observatory, so there will be something deeply romantic and satisfying about taking the book with me when I move from Heidelberg to Pasadena in order to begin pursuing my astronomy PhD at Caltech. When I'm banging my head against the wall fitting datasets or writing telescope proposals, Preston and Gunn will remind me of the big picture.  I love astronomy and doing astronomy research, but Im a little nervous about becoming a graduate student. In his book Awakenings, the neurologist Oliver Sacks describes the feeling as follows: we are over-developed in mechanical competence, but lacking in biological intelligence, intuition, awareness; and it is this, above all, that we need to regain, not only in medicine, but in all science. For Sacks, a doctor, the point is that treating" or "curing" a human being is a lot more than wielding a syringe. It can and should involve compassionate listening and emotional support. We risk forgetting that as we become more technologically advanced. Im not a doctor and my science is less obviously related to human beings, but as an undergraduate I've happily engaged with people through teaching and public outreach, and enjoyed pursuing a variety of interests through classes. At MIT, surrounded by the very highest mechanical competence, I feel like I was rescued by my humanities classes and my various extracurricular activities: I became a much better teacher and writer and speaker, and learned about cultures and civilizations in addition to scientific ideas and numerical techniques. All that said, Ive been told that the goal of graduate school is to focus and Im not sure how to best stay in touch with other interests and values.  Awakenings reminds me of all of this, so it sits on my bookshelf, leaning on First Light. * * * I spent the first semester of senior year frantically trying to make plans for the future: interviews, phone calls, essays, applications, letters of recommendation, presentations. This semester, those plans are set and my task is to transition out of here. The hardest part is deciding what should come with me and what should stay behind. It took me two hours spread over three days to trim down my bookshelf, and I'm still not feeling comfortable about all those old psets... Next up are my clothes. I just took out a new cardboard box, and tossed in a pair of sweatpants that I want to donate. While I work on that, go take a look at your bookshelf (if you haven't already) and tell me (I'm curious): which books have kept you company for a long time? It's that time of year again - SpringFest!  This past weekend was filled with fun events like the McCormick Hall picnic and lots of energy saving activities.  But my personal favorite event was SpringFest's annual concert, featuring Capital Cities and Flosstradamus! The opening act was Scavenger Hunt, and they were really awesome! I got to test out my new camera during their set, and I am pretty happy with the results.      After the first three songs, I had some down time to go around and see some friends!  There were about 9 EMTs roaming around that I got to hang out with, as well as some friends from East Campus!   Then it was time for Capital Cities!  They were fantastic - the trumpet solos especially were incredible!        And then the final act - Flosstradamus! They definitely got the crowd moving and jumping all around.   Overall, the concert was great, the set-up was beautiful, and SpringFest was a success :)  Last night, MIT sophomores dressed in black-tie attire flocked to the beautiful State Room in Boston to receive their glorious Brass Rats! Michael C. '16 explained in his post about Ring Premiere what the design of our ring looks like, but as of last night we now have our own beautiful rings to show to the world on our beautiful 2016 hands! LOOK AT MY PRETTY RING!  It feels so good! I have many pictures from and of the event, mostly of my fellow Tetazoa and other East Campusers, but some with and of friends in my class that I was really excited to see! We had a great time, and afterwards a bunch of us went to Bova's Bakery to get Cannoli's together! Here are some pictures of the event and of my beautiful friends!    We even got to take a series of prom pictures!      We also took more prom pictures once we got to the event!    It definitely felt like prom - the view from the State room was absolutely gorgeous!  We got some really nice shots in front of the beautiful view.   And here is Nico F. '16, one of the members of RingComm, the committee that plans ring delivery and designed our beautiful ring!  AND THEN I FOUND HARRY B. '16!! Yay Harry! He's so Canadian!   Of course I needed a picture with Harry! Thanks to Will R. '16 for taking this picture! Here is Will:  I also got a picture with Jake I. '16! We took a "selfie."  And Random Hall showed up to the event in full black-tie attire :)  There was a beautiful ice sculpture in the shape of a ring! Sadly, the sculpture mysteriously disapeared a while into the event.  THE VENUE WAS SO PRETTY AND CLASSY!    THAT VIEW!  And there were so many photographers! Eurah K. '16 and I took pictures with our fancy cameras.  We also had a mini Intel STS '12 reunion! We couldn't find Adam K. '16, sadly, but we did have Ani P. '16, Jin P. '16, Jordan C. '16 and me!  And I found some of my course 3 friends! Here are Isabel C. '16 and I with our new Brass Rats! Photo taken by Nick M. '16:  And here are Nick and Isabel looking pretty!  Tetazoo arrived at Ring Delivery initially with Beast, the second floor of the east parallel (we are the third floor, known as the third east traveling animal zoo).  However, as the night progressed, we found ourselves additionally hanging out with Florey, the fifth floor. Usually we have a small rivalry with that floor, but last night we put our differences aside in order to potentially accomplish greater things.    After ring delivery, a bunch of us went to Bova's to get cannoli's!  So overall, the event was a huge success! We had a bunch of fun dressing up, goofing off, and just hanging out together as a class.   And finally, as always, I will end this post with pictures of cats! Today is Galileo and Thor's third birthday!!! They got wet food as a birthday present from their wonderful owner, Kerry N. '14.    If you're a regular on /r/technology, you might have seen Project Naptha trending the front page. I've blogged a couple of times already about hackathons at MIT and how amazing they are in the amount of experience, learning, and motivation they can give you in the space of ten or twenty sleepless hours. Project Naptha, created by my classmate Kevin K. '17, is a Chrome extension whose birth I witnessed (and blogged about) at HackMIT last October. Then called "ImagesAsText," he took home second prize (and $2000) for his work. What, exactly, does Project Naptha do? From the website: You can see it in action on the Project Naptha website. It's pretty amazing. Essentially, it detects text from memes, image macros, screenshots, graphs, scanned images, and even certain photographs (yes, that includes rotated text) and treats it as highlightable text. Then, using some nifty image processing, it allows you to remove that text from the image entirely, or replace it with its translation in a different language, or replace it with whatever text you desire. There's even an Easter egg that gives the selected text an animation. It does all of this image processing in real time, with no discernible lag or delay. It can do this for pretty much every language on the Internet, including non-latinate languages like Chinese and Russian. Kevin is kind of a hacker extraordinaire. Project Naptha has since been picked up by PCWorld, the Verge, Engadget, and CNET. CNET calls it "nothing short of JavaScript black magic." Since its release yesterday, it has had upward of 52,000 downloads (as of 5:09 PM EDT on April 25).  It's not perfect, but it comes very, very close, really limited only by the technologies of optical character recognition, translation quality, and the image processing that fills in the image where text is removed (think Photoshop's Content Aware Fill). The only question really left is--can it do Captchas? Signing off, Allan Add Project Naptha to Chrome here. For demos and backstory, check out the website. You: Where are you from?Me: London.You: But you...you don't...you don't seem to have a British accent.Me: Correct. Let me explain! I was born in Singapore, had a Singaporean accent, then moved to London during the summer before fifth... read more  see complete archives  My name is Anna Ho, and I am a student at  No, no. Thats not the point. My name is Anna Ho, and I am a constituent living in Cambridge. I am a student at MIT majoring in physics. Ugh, I sound like a robot. Sound cheerful! BE cheerful! ITS SO EXCITING TO BE HERE! Hi! Thank you so much for taking the time to meet with us. My name is Anna Ho, and Im a constituent living in Cambridge. Im a senior at MIT majoring in physics, but today Im here representing the American Astronomical Society. ...and Im very nervous, because Im an idealistic 21-year-old who would really like to think that its better to Engage than it is to Criticise From Afar, and somehow I find myself here in DC to meet with my representatives. Ive heard that people charge into policy work feeling like theyre going to change the world, and soon become disenchanted and frustrated. And Im afraid that on Wednesday, I will find out that all of these meetings with my representatives are just formalities to win my vote. * * * Our training begins on Monday March 24. Around ten of us have arrived in DC already, and we start by going around the room and introducing ourselves. The guy to my left works at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Maryland, building cameras for telescopes. The woman to my right does research on the sun at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. Theres a professor from Northwestern somewhere behind me. There are a handful of graduate students, and Im the token undergraduate. The first speaker is Josh Shiode. Josh has a PhD in astronomy from UC Berkeley and is now a John Bahcall Public Policy Fellow at the American Astronomical Society (AAS). Translation: he brought his scientific training and communication talents with him to the policy world of Washington D.C. He communicates in two directions: he advocates on behalf of the astronomy community to policymakers, and keeps the astronomy community informed about important changes in policy. This week, his job is to prepare a delegation of 15 AAS members to lobby on Capitol Hill. This Monday afternoon, his talk is called Congress in Context. I frantically take notes, trying to go from Zero Knowledge to Enough Knowledge. Congress in Context: Josh walks us through how a bill becomes a law (the takeaway: very few do) and introduces us to important vocabulary. The deficit, for example. Non-defense discretionary spending (our stuff!) and the nature of its shrinking. The Budget Control Act, the Bipartisan Budget Act, high spending on mandatory programs, the difference between authorizations and appropriations (the theory and the reality), examples of authorizing committees, examples of appropriating committees. Current status: the Presidents Budget Request  which proposes spending levels for each agency  is out. Now, Congress is working on actually allocating funding (appropriations), in theory within the authorized bounds. There are many organizations lobbying on Capitol Hill for a piece of nondefense discretionary pie, and we are one of them. No pressure. After a short coffee break (astronomers have caffeine running through their veins) we reconvene for a talk by Anna Quider, who works at the US State Department. Anna is another PhD astronomer who decided to dedicate her life to policy, and her job this afternoon is to introduce us to our audience. Our audience is: Congressional Staff. Before you walk into the House or the Senate, she says, you need to understand who these people are. Each Member of Congress has a group of Congressional Staff (staffers) who distill and relay information to the congressman about particular issues, to help him or her cast an informed vote. This sounds like an enormous responsibility, so I am astonished to learn that some staffers are not a whole lot older than I am. For many staffers, Anna tells us, this is their FIRST JOB EVER. Theyre smart 20- or 30-something year olds, expected to become experts in a wide variety of areas often outside their educational background. When Anna was a staffer, her portfolio included education, small business and entrepreneurship, national security, innovation, and all of science and technology. When the staffer in charge of healthcare issues left, Anna was given that job, and told: well, science is the next closest thing.  To help staffers, there is a non-partisan knowledge tank on Capitol Hill called the Congressional Research Service. But even with this resource, consider what the job entails: teaching yourself about a vast range of complicated and important issues that you have limited (or no) academic experience with, picking out the salient points, then relaying information up the chain to a Member of Congress. With this in mind, Anna shows us a typical staffer schedule: it is packed from 8am until 9pm, with no obvious breaks.  The fact that [the staffer you contacted] took your meeting request is a small miracle, Anna said. You have a foot in the door. These are a PRECIOUS TWENTY MINUTES. She mentions that our 30-minute scheduled meeting might end up lasting two minutes and be held standing in a hallway, or even turn out to include a bunch of other scientists from other organizations. Thanks to Anna, I have a mental image of the very hard-working but very busy person I will be meeting with on Wednesday. Obviously, I cant waste this persons time. What is special about me? What information can I uniquely deliver? * * * The last session on Monday is led by Jen Greenamoyer, a Senior Government Relations Liaison at the American Institute of Physics. With her, we will finally begin to hammer out what exactly to say during our meetings. The talk is titled: Delivering Your Message on Capitol Hill and I take away five key points: Heads swimming, we break into groups for a roleplay activity. I become Jason Ellis, lobbyist for an organization called Save Our Coastal Resources. The Space Telescope Science Institute astronomer to my left becomes congresswoman Katherine Greer, a Republican from Oregon who is currently undecided about how to vote on a bill. The Harvard-Smithsonian astronomer to my right becomes Allison Lowder, a lobbyist for the U.S. Shrimpers Association. We each have something like 5 minutes to skim a briefing on the bill, then hold a meeting with the congresswoman trying to persuade her to vote one way or the other. Allison Lowder holds her meeting while I run out to the bathroom, and I come back pumped to argue on behalf of SOCR. The Sawfish will become extinct if no steps are taken to protect it, I say. All life on our planet is connected and dependent on each other, and there is serious threat to this species... At the end, I feel pretty good about my spiel. But Congresswoman Lowder votes no, and Allison Lowder cheers. What did I do wrong?! As we switch groups, Congresswoman Katherine Greer turns to me and says: you know why I voted no? Grumpily, I ask why. Because she he points to Lowder  went first. That night, in front of the mirror: My name is Anna Ho, and Im a constituent living in Cambridge. Im a senior at MIT majoring in physics, but today Im here representing the American Astronomical Society. In the fall, Im going to start a PhD program in astronomy.  Here is my contact information. If I can be a resource for you, please dont hesitate to contact me.  * * * On Monday, the talks were about science advocacy in general; today, the focus is on astronomy. Its Tuesday, all fifteen of us are finally here, and were sitting in a conference room at American Astronomical Society headquarters. At 9am, the Executive Officer gives us a warm welcome before leaving to go sign checks or something (he makes us laugh at 9am, which is no mean feat). For the next three hours, the AAS Director of Public Policy joins forces with Josh to bring us up to speed. They review terminology from yesterday, this time highlighting particular authorization bills that directly affect our field. They fill us in on current astronomy policy issues, most of which involve the National Science Foundation. Themes from yesterday resurface: your primary currency is your credibility, if you prove to be a useful resource people will come back to you, your face and your personal story alone are worth the visit. I take notes as usual but am a little distracted by the thought that woah, the AAS Director of Public Policy is sitting next to me. I snap out of my reverie when someone down the table asks what to do if were asked about the NSF Portfolio Review. Asked about the what?! The response is that if we get asked about the NSF Portfolio Review, we are to go out and have a beer to celebrate that someone up on Capitol Hill actually knows what the NSF is. If we get tough but informed questions, thats a reason to celebrate. At this point, the Associate Vice President for Research at the University of Alabama in Huntsville chimes in to remind us that our job is to promote our field, not to bash other fields or other organizations. I dont think it ever benefits anybody, he says, to speak from the perspective of negativity. Much more effective to present a united front, instead of bickering amongst ourselves while the politicians go deal with other issues. After lunch, we travel to the headquarters of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS). We sit through a series of talks. The highlight is a Q&A with staffers: Sean Gallagher from Congressman Rush Holts office is particularly enthusiastic and articulate. Were a filter for our boss, he tells us, but we tend to be a mile wide and an inch deep. You are our educators. Takeaways include: Suddenly, I realize what information I can uniquely provide during my meetings. I pull out my notebook to scribble down the first draft of my message. * * * Its Tuesday night and Im lying on my stomach in my hotel room bed. Tomorrow morning, I will lead meetings with staffers from two Massachusetts offices: Representative Michael Capuanos office and Senator Ed Markeys office. Im frantically reviewing. Michael Capuano. Very passionate about higher education. Makes sense, considering that the 7th congressional district has over a dozen research institutes, universities (including MIT and Harvard) and teaching hospitals. 1/5 of Nobel Prize winners have lived, studied, or worked in this district. Capuano has a lot to be proud of. Capuanos staffer: Andrew Eaton. BA in Political Science from U. Conn. Portfolio includes: budget, tax, social security, education, science, welfare, US Postal Service. Ed Markey. Already supportive of expanding investment in science research programs. This meeting can probably be short. Markeys staffer: Dan Pomeroy. PhD in High Energy Experimental Physics, has worked at the Large Hadron Collider. This meeting can definitely be short. My name is Anna Ho, and Im a constituent living in Cambridge. Im a senior at MIT majoring in physics, but today Im here representing the American Astronomical Society. In the fall, Im going to start a PhD program in astronomy, but when I started college I didnt think that I was cut out to be a research scientist. The summer after my sophomore year, I did an internship funded by the National Science Foundation. I loved it so much that I went back the next summer and did it again. I learned that I wanted to do research because I had the opportunity to try doing research. And I had that opportunity because of this program. I became a scientist because of this program.  I set my alarm for 6am and dream about sleeping through meetings. - Part 2 to follow -   Im fast asleep, probably snoring lightly and elegantly. My bodys shut down. Why, you ask? Why, you really ask? Why not? Ive just had all my rights violated by the Massassassachisetts Institvte of Technology and the Arts, passing through a 3-midterm, 1-pset, 1-mini-paper week. Its finally the weekenda four-day weekend at thatbut MIT has another thing coming if it thinks giving me four days off will be sufficient bribe to calm my fiery sense of injustice.  So Im probably just having some meandering, semi-psychopathic dream that will no doubt trudge its way into the dreary stew of words Ill call a story when my alarm goes off. The stupid thing begins blaring and blaring and oh please shut up! Anyway, I manage to rise and after mumbling a couple of sleepy words no doubt filled with infinite wisdom, I realize that its nearly five p.m.  I mumble an expletive I cant use on this blog, because cats read it or something and they lose a life for each such word. Im supposed to meet up with my advisor. Its Saturday, and he has a nice outing planned. Its one of those things where MIT tries to compensate for beating the crap out of everyone by offering nice dinners, and I was actually looking forward to eating something that couldnt crawl out of my plate or didnt seem to be having heart palpitations (yes, this is a not-even-slightly-veiled reference to the varied assortments of muck and dredge Maseeh Dining serves). Cue to me walking down Mass Ave, where Bostons accursed weather is actually kind of nice for once. Maybe too nice. Im suspicious, but I can wear a T-Shirt and thats fine. Im supposed to meet up my advisor, Saif Rayyan, in his car, with his wife and some of my classmates from Concourse. After a few minutes of texting and jaywalking and all manner of things that form the basis of Youtube ads, I finally lumber past the lumbering Stata Center (and can we please just talk about Stata! Its like concrete someone chewed, swallowed and regurgitated. What gives?!). And there he is! I tumble into the backseat of his car, where my friend and classmate Ava waves ever so nicely at me. You rock, Ava. Saifs wife is in the front seat beside him. Next comes the question of where to eat. My brain is still mostly fried from sleep so I suggest somewhere in MIT. We also debate other places, like Legal Seafood, which is just a fancy place you willingly let steal your money. But when my advisor calls, we find that its been fully booked, and that the restaurant is unable to steal from us at this time. Thus, we head to Woodys instead, a nice, picturesque (yes, that is a pretentious word, stop judging me!) restaurant a walk away from the Boston University Theatre, where my advisor has bought play tickets for us. But to get to Woodys, we have to go through All That Is Wrong With Earth And Life that is the Boston traffic. This at least allows for decent chatter, where we talk about exams and home and the meaning of life. In Woodys, we need to decide what to eat. After much deliberation, we settle on the sole hallmark and signifier of Americas achievementsthe Pizza. We add all sorts of things to itmushrooms and onions and pineapples and a few things that should be made mandatory at every meal. I show initial concern about how much to get, but my advisor does his marvelous job and advises me to let MIT have it! Its on them after all. And so I descend into a travesty of near-gluttonous abandon, ordering all the things. This evening, crimes against the stomach are at an all time high, starring such villains as***3 20 oz. glasses of orange juice ***six or seven or nine slices of pizza; after a while, you lose track and the world around you just glows with the pepperoni hue of pizza-induced hallucinations ***creme brulee! Because why not? Though it came riddled with a bunch of fruits I could have done without. And before your glaring eyes furl up in mortified consternation and all such politically correct reactions, you should realize that I spent the past several hours, from before eating to the previous evening mostly sleeping, and had pretty much eaten nothing since then. That said, by the time I was done, my stomach had swelled to epic proportions, and I sat there feeling like Id eaten a couple of Santa Clauses. Hee. But mostly eww. But mostly hee. Wut? Anyway, with everyone else done eating as well, we rise as one and head to the Boston University Theatre. The weather is still nice, and nope, Im still not buying it. Somethings up. At the Theatre, we meet one more Concourse student, and Saifs wife retreats somewhere backstage. Shes a classical pianist and will be one of many contributing to the operas beautiful music. The opera by the way is titled Don Giovanni, and after the execrable atrocity that was Paranormal Activity (how did that drivel get so many sequels), Im confident that this will be much better. I struggle through a bunch of people all standing around and talking, and walk into the dimly lit theater where I take my seat. My advisor is two seats away and he seems happy. I remember some stories his wife told us of him falling asleep in some of the past operas and giggle. Hee. Soon enough, the curtains rise and we begin with a dramatic flashing of lights, red and blue and orange against a heavy musical backdrop of swelling piano notes and grand trumpeting. Pretty quickly into the opera, theres a murder. Some random old dude is stabbed. He sings and moans and sings as fake blood squirts out, and I know Im gonna enjoy this. Its a three-hour opera though, three hours, and Ill be honest. I had a few issues with the pacing of the story, but the songs were really enjoyable, the actors extremely talented and a lot of lines pretty funny. Don Giovanni is one heck of a Lady Magnet, maybe too much, and thats pretty adorable. When hes not, you know, running from girl to girl or proposing to a woman with her fiance just barely out of earshot. Hes a jerk, and thats the point. A funny, lovable jerk in his own right, but a jerk nonetheless. And you can tell somethings gonna happen, retribution-wise. Hell get beaten to death or stomped on or stabbed or shot orare you kidding me? Thats how you decide to do it? Large sounds and flames and him falling backwards and a crack of hell and well, okay, this was a fun show so Ill accept. After a pretty enjoyable time, the opera is over, and the curtain falls. We get to clap hard for all the actors and actresses, and I see something pretty interesting. I see Saif, my physics teacher and advisor, cheer for the actors, which is fine, but hes really cheering, with great energy and stuff, along the lines of: Wuuuuuuuu! Yeaaah! Wuuuu! Wuuu! Wuu! Wuuuuuuu! Wuuuuuuuuuuuuu! WUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU! Its really nice to see and Im having laughing fits all over the place, as we leave the Theatre and stumble out into The outside! And aha! I knew there was something most foul (I just watched an opera! I get to say things like most foul) about the weathers niceness. It was a trap. Now, its pretty cold and Im shivering like a Course 18 about to see their HASS grade. (P.S. Ive actually seen a Course 18 see his grade for a HASS class. It would seem they dont shiver so much as bite their lips all serious-like and mumble a good number of Hmms). Saif drives us back to our respective dorms and we bid him adieu. ***So all in all, it was a pretty nice day, and Im willing to concede that MIT does a nice job of trying to connect students and faculty whenever possible. I hear you all screaming cop-out, but Im typing this post on the heels of a fugue-like, barely conscious state (psets, programming, enough error messages from Python to scar me for several lifetimes, dont ask) so Ill just tell you to deal with it. And after things like the evening with my advisor, the doorway to sappy sentimentality opens up. A bunch of thoughts flash through my head. Exams and psets and friends and complaining. And I realize that yup, I absolutely love this place. See you guys on the other side. Other side of what, you ask? Good question.    I've mentioned in prior posts that my hall, Tetazoo, in East Campus is very involved in climbing and hiking and other wonderful adventures.  We traditionally have a camping trip each fall, but this year Kayla E. '15 and Becca G. '14 organized a last minute spring camping trip with 18 people out to Rumney, New Hampshire.  We were all extremely excited for this last minute opportunity to relax and have some fun climbing, hiking, and camping in the wilderness.  We split into four cars with three different agendas: I was a part of Car 3 with Jackie. We were all excited for the adventure, and drove up Sunday night to Rumney, New Hampshire, to camp outside of the MITOC (MIT Outdoors Club) Camelot Cabin.  I actually saw Cathie Y. '16 there on a different MITOC adventure! Once all 18 of us tetazoans (and some friends) set up camp, we gathered around the fire and roasted some marshmallows.  At one point, Cappie P. '13 stood up and informed us that there was a place in the woods nearby called the "Observatory," which was a small clearing of trees and an overturned canoe where you can sit and watch the stars.  Five of us went to follow him on a search for the overturned canoe.  We quickly found ourselves hiking around in circles, stepping on snow and rocks and the tiny river that ran through the lot.  Cappie left with Barbie D. '17 back to camp, and the rest of us went searching for the stars. We eventually found the overturned canoe, and the astrophotographer among us, NiBr '17, took some beautiful pictures of the sky. Finally, we started our hike back to camp.  However, we found ourselves lost in the woods late at night, and couldn't even find the campfire from where we were.  We trekked through the forest, and finally saw some lights - however, they were street lights, not cabin lights. The cabin was a small hike from where we parked our cars on the street, so we headed towards the lights.  Along the way, we found a mobile home, and the widest part of the river we possibly could have found in that area. We hopped along the stones in the rapidly flowing river, and we found our way to the street. We ended up two large lots away from where we had parked our cars, but eventually found our way back to the rest of our group, excited from the adventure we just had. We all woke up early the next morning, ate our bagels that we had brought for the trip, and got on our way to our separate adventures.  My group of Cars 3 and 4 decided to do a small hike with a pretty waterfall, known as Nancy Cascades. It was supposed to be a nice two hour hike, and we figured that we could stop at the top of the waterfalls to eat our lunch and relax for a bit, maybe even take a nap. The ride there was fun. Sadun '17 got on the wheel, and although he frightened us at times, it was a lot of fun and he kept trying to get us to play road games and sings songs about bears and things. We saw all sorts of great things along the way, including cows!   The thing is, we couldn't find the trail head. We had a map, but we didn't purchase the New Hampshire trail book ahead of time because we thought we didn't need it.  So we found a parking lot near the GPS coordinates on the website, and started walking in the direction we figured the trail head probably was.  The place we parked near had a trail head for Davis Path, which I was really excited for, but everyone else wanted to look for waterfalls. I also love waterfalls, so I followed.  Still, we found some nature!  We stopped to ask for directions - twice -  and finally found our way to the trail head!  It was an adventure getting there, that's for sure. It was all in good fun!  At least there was more nature!  Finally, we found a trail head, which supposedly led to the trail we needed to follow to get to Nancy Cascades.  We made our way up a mountain, excited for the adventure. However, in front of us was a trail filled with miles of snow. It made it a bit difficult to get around.    The snow was pretty bad, but we kept pushing forward. Eventually we made it to the actual Nancy Cascades trail, marked by some bloody red paint. We took turns posing with the painted rocks all around us.   And we found more nature!  But with the nature came a whole lot of terrible snow.  It really was quite awful trekking through the snow without snow gear.  There was about a foot-wide path of packed down snow, but if you stepped off the path or slid outside of that area you found yourself waist-deep in cold, wet snow. It was still a really pretty adventure, though.    It took us a lot longer than we thought to get anywhere because of the snow. Almost three hours into the hike, and we were unsure about if we were even halfway to the top! We finally decided to stop by a really pretty area by the river for lunch and to dry our socks and shoes for a bit in the sun. It was really nice out - almost in the 70s - yet we were surrounded by snow!  After our break, we continued on the path, which was a bit more clearly labeled now since it had some steep areas that were really icy, as well as some ledged areas which were a little scary.  Finally, we found a sign! It didn't tell us where we were though or how much further we had to go, but we did feel a bit better that at least we were on the right path.  Eventually, we set a time for ourselves to give up. We left for the hike around 10:30am-ish, and it was closing in on 2pm. After falling into and out of snow and starting to lose the feeling in our toes and legs, three of us decided to stop where we were at 1:50pm and wait there for the group, which would turn around at 2pm anyways. We told them to yell back at us if they find the cascades in the next ten minutes, and we waited.  We waited ten minutes and heard nothing. We waited ten more minutes. After waiting 25 minutes in the snow, we left them a note on tree bark.   As we started walking back, two more of our hiking friends ran to catch up to us.  They had done the same thing as us five minutes out, and had also given up on the three people ahead of us, but told us that they had heard that the three hikers at the head of the trail had finally found the Nancy Cascades! They said that it was beautiful, but not really worth us going back for it because it would take another half hour. So we all turned around, and with me at the head of the group, made our way out of Nancy Cascades, not so excited for the slippery slopes ahead of us.    After our really long, and at times painful, hike, we all got together and rested. I walked back to the car with my bare feet on the hot asphalt of the New Hampshire highway, and we went back to Rumney, New Hampshire, to meet up with the rest of our group. Six of us changed our minds about going hiking during the night, and we shuffled around cars until it worked out.  We warned the other cars about the snowy conditions they will encounter during the night, and headed home a day early. I was really happy to get home. It's nice to be away from the snow and back in my comfy bed.  And, as always, the cats were really happy to have some of us back.    How was your CPW? It was definitely one of my favorites. I had lots of fun meeting a you future froshies in person. Today I wanted to address some concerns about CPW by sharing my own experiences. Recently, I got into Reddit (bad idea at this time of semester), especially r/MIT. One post that hit close to home was titled "Did anyone here not enjoy CPW but still love MIT once they were actually a student?" A prefrosh talked about how he felt he wouldn't fit into the MIT community because, during CPW,  all the events were about "legos" and "foam swords" and other kiddie kid stuff for little kids. He went to the informative events, but found himself one of the few prefrosh there. It was really hard connecting with other prefrosh, as it seemed that they were all on board with doing kiddie things for fun but he didn't share those interests. Even though I personally had lots of fun during my CPW, that same thought always floated around in the back of my head. I felt I wouldn't fit in unless my idea of a fun time was playing Super Smash Bros until 5 am while stuffing my face with mashed potatoes. Like the prefrosh in that thread, I too was one of the few prefrosh to go to the more official and "mature" events. I was worried that people didn't share my interests. But, as it turns out, CPW was more of an indicator of the kinds of things you COULD do with friends if you wanted to, not the things you'd have to participate in if you want to have fun here. When I came to MIT in the fall, I met so many people that destroyed that kiddie stereotype. During CPW, everything was hectic and squeezed into four days. During orientation and rush week, I got to know people from so many backgrounds, all with different ideas for fun. I immediately got involved with my dorm, other student groups, and fraternity life. I met people who liked the things I liked doing, so I felt at home. But I also become friends with people who I would've never imagined being friends with. We try making CPW as best as we can, but nomatter what, it'll always be such a small window to the vastness of the types of people that make up MIT. Besides, if you think that all we do are kiddie things, then you are mistaken, just like I was. We do pretty manly stuff. You know what's really manly? Steak. You know what's even manlier? Steak at 1 am. You know what goes great with steak at 1 am? Milk shakes. Cue Steak and Shake, which was held at Phi Kappa Sigma every CPW night. After a long hard day of having fun, prefrosh came and relaxed, enjoying steak and shake while playing pool and talking to brothers and other prefrosh about anything and everything. On Saturday night, I stayed up with three prefrosh until 5 am, at which point we decided that we might as well continue staying awake to watch the sunrise. It always had such a chill atmosphere, and everyone had a great time.  But I wasn't at Phi Kappa Sigma enjoying the classic atmosphere the entire CPW. I also did nonsensical things with my friends, like watching them cover their faces with sugar by blowing into cups.  There was also a great performance by the MIT improv comedy troupe Roadkill Buffet. Super manly and mature? Maybe not, but who cares? It was funny. Let loose and have fun.  At MIT, no matter what your type is, there's always a group of people who share your interests. Maybe your type is playing with foam swords in a ball pit. Maybe your type is going to a classy business luncheon and networking with econ professors. Maybe your type is playing pool at 1 am with a refreshing milkshake in one hand and a juicy piece of steak in the other. Or maybe your type is doing all three. Whichever way, MIT is a great place where you'll meet some of the coolest people you'll know for the rest of your life. Plus, who wouldn't want to hang out with these AXO girls?

There are literally (literally!) a dozen blog posts I wish I could write for you right now but I cant, at least not for at least another week. I want to talk to you, especially since some of you need to decide whether or not to come to MIT and the rest of you might be bored. This is an open conversation. I will answer any (any!) question you ask as honestly as I would if I were the one asking.  second semester senior at MIT, majoring in computer science and molecular biology (6-7) and math (18) and minoring in writing (21W).

Scrolling through the original message, I saw a comment that "Dudamel is cool." So, even though I had no idea whether Dudamel was a music genre, an instrument, a song title, or a composer, I replied "I'm definitely down! :)" and reserved a ticket. A month later, Google Calendar told me that I should meet Ashley at MIT's Kresge Auditorium. The theater was PACKED (I thought: "wow! this Dudamel thing must be *very* cool!") but we squeezed and "sorry! excuse me!"d our way in. Flipping through my program, I learned very quickly that Dudamel is not a music genre. Dudamel is not an instrument, or a song title, or a composer. Dudamel is, according to the program bio, "Music Director of both the Simon Bolivar Symphony Orchestra of Venezuela and the Los Angeles Philharmonic, and the impact of his musical leadership is felt on four continents." His guest conducting appearances include the NY Philharmonic and the Munich Philharmonic. Feeling very uncultured, I went on to read that he was voted into the Gramophone Hall of Fame, has won a gazillion awards, is in the Royal Swedish Academy of Music, and was one of Time Magazine's 100 most influential people in 2009. Yep. Definitely not a musical instrument. I got a little bored of the laundry list of musical accolades, so it was refreshing - and a little surprising - to read that Harvard recently awarded him the Q Prize "for extraordinary service to children." I was equally surprised to look up and see small children sitting on stage: in the front row, there were 7- and 8-year-olds clutching miniature violins with their feet dangling above the ground. Turns out that the "concert" was actually an open rehearsal, as part of the Sistema Side by Side seminario series. A seminario is a tradition in Venezuela, where Dudamel is from. According to the program, a seminario is "a larger ensemble community." "Children from music programs in various neighborhoods and regions frequently come together...to make music together." This particular seminario was made up of: children from the Los Angeles Philharmonic Youth Orchestra (YOLA) who had flown across the country for this event + children from Massachusetts + conservatory students from the Longy School of Music of Bard College. The MA kids and the Longy students were paired up as part of a community program called Side By Side: they've been rehearsing together every weekend for the past year. They all wore matching black t-shirts that said SIDE BY SIDE in white letters. The timpani pair were particularly adorable; there was a little kid wearing a cast partnered up with a tall young man from Longy, and their height ratio was about 1:2. It was a very strange construction: the intimacy of a children's orchestral rehearsal up on stage in front of a gigantic audience, led by a famous conductor. The audience was packed with parents, sponsors, and random MIT community members who were on some mailing lists and might not have known a whole lot about what they were walking into. The man in front of me spent the entire rehearsal Facetiming on his iPhone with a woman who I presume was the mother of one of the young performers. Imagine what this meant for Dudamel himself: as my friend Davie '12 (who was also at the concert) put it, he had three different - not obviously reconcilable - tasks. He had to, as the conductor, run a functional and productive rehearsal. As a performer (and when a Kresge Auditorium-ful of people are watching you, you are performing whether you like it or not) he had to entertain. As the conductor of a performing children's orchestra, he had to make the children comfortable up there on the stage. Spoiler alert: he did all three, spectacularly. After an introduction that included a thank-you to Rafael Reif for providing space at MIT (WOOOOO! MIT!!!!!) Dudamel finally walked on stage. On his way from stage right to the podium, he shook hands with several of the children and beamed at everybody. When the auditorium fell silent, he asked one of the kid's in the front row: "it's too warm in here! is it okay if I take off my jacket?" I guess the kid gave Dudamel his blessing, because Dudamel took off his fancy jacket to reveal a black t-shirt and jeans. He eased himself onto a wooden stool and leaned his elbows on his knees. And just like that, the entire auditorium relaxed too. My first impression of Dudamel was: "Wow, Dudamel is adorably awkward." He stumbled over his words, mumbling that he didn't really know the music that well, actually he didn't know the music at all, and what were we even here to play again? Some little kid told him the answer. "Oh, okay," he said. "You guys will have to lead me, because I don't know the music." Ha! The orchestra were playing the Farandole from Bizet's L'Arlesienne Suite No. 2 and the Finale from Tchaikovsky's Symphony No. 5 in E Minor, and so of course Dudamel had both of those pieces totally committed to memory (not to mention he was 110% prepared for the rehearsal). But it was a trick to make the kids more comfortable with him, and it was endearing. He reminded me of Papageno, for those of you familiar with Mozart's Magic Flute -- he adopted a kind of charming woodland creature quality, perching on the edge of that stool. He occasionally shifted to look over his shoulder and quip to the audience. And then he lifted up his baton, and I realized that Dudamel isn't awkward at all; he's just expertly theatrical. Before long, he had left his stool and was standing up and Papageno was out of my mind; instead, I thought that Dudamel could be a dancer, the way he stood up straight and seemed to have complete control of every single movement. He also had the BEST similes. "These two phrases," he would say. "They are the same on paper, no? They are like twins. But twins - you are still different, a little bit. So we must play them differently." To describe a grand passage, a dancer's thumping long legs. To describe a passage of rapid notes, a dancer's short scuttling legs. He was really brilliant, and I wish I wrote more of these down, but I was too busy being totally captivated. At the end of the performance, Jamie Bernstein - Leonard Bernstein's daughter (WOAH! LEONARD BERNSTEIN'S DAUGHTER!) presented an award to Dudamel: the Leonard Bernstein Lifetime Achievement Award for the Elevation of Music in Society. "With this award," Jamie read aloud from the program, "Longy recognizes an artistic leader whose life has been dedicated to inspiring and enriching lives through music. The Bernstein laureate, whether as a performer or teacher" - and here she broke from the program and said "OR BOTH!" - "exemplifies how music can lift spirits, raise the level of culture in society, and transform lives." Dudamel said that he was part of the El Sistema family (the program in Venezuela that inspired Side by Side) and was receiving the award as part of that family and not as an individual. And then it was time to leave. Dudamel got the audience to give an extra gigantic round of applause for the little timpani player. "He's the best timpani player I have ever seen in an orchestra!" Dudamel announced. "Playing with one hand!" (the kid had a cast.) He gave the timpani player a hug, then turned outward and smiled at all of us. "I am becoming an old man," he said. "Because, when you feel like a father, you are becoming an old man." He left the stage, and the parents in the audience rushed up to be with their kids.   On Sunday morning the Design/Build/Fly team rolled out of bed at 6:30 AM, roughed up and ready to fly on the last day of the competition. We had one more mission to fly and we wanted to re-fly a mission as well in order to score a little higher. We were on the clock--the weather forecasted heavy rain and a thunderstorm starting around noon, in which case the competition would go on hold and awards would be given based on the current scores. The last mission was the emergency medical mission: the assignment was to carry a two-pound payload (distributed between four blocks arranged to simulate medical attendants standing next to patients on gurneys) for three laps around the course in as short a time as possible. We knew that our Corn Dog was the fastest plane at the competition--however, the heavy winds of Saturday showed no signs of dying down, and Corn Dog was a little worse for wear after yesterday's heavy flying. The time to beat was 1 minute and 55 seconds. Corn Dog's turn came while the sun was still out, and we quickly moved outside, packed the cargo into the payload bay, and got ready to fly.   Loading up. Corn Dog took off smoothly into the wind, turned around, and completed two and a half laps with no problems at all. As it came around the final turn to approach the finish line, a collective gasp went up from the crowd (along with fearful yelps and held breaths from we the team members) as Corn Dog yelped a loud SNAP and began making the very unhealthy-sounding buzzing sound of an electric razor. Corn Dog dipped out of the air--then fluttered back up again--then dipped again and charged forward through the finish line with a final time of 1 minute and 49 seconds. Success! But Corn Dog was still in the air, still buzzing loudly, and stumbling around looking like it had broken a leg. As we held our breaths and crossed our fingers, Adam (our pilot) turned Corn Dog around and landed it intact on the pavement.   Coming in literally on a wing and a prayer. Cue sighs of relief and thunderous applause.  Adam (who we are forever and ever indebted to for his amazing flying, and who has also guest-blogged for MITAdmissions), told us that he'd lost control of one of the ailerons (so Corn Dog was indeed a crippled dog for the last 100 feet or so of the flight). Examining the plane revealed that that aileron had undergone flutter, where it essentially resonates with the air going over it and vibrates wildly out of control. For Corn Dog, this meant that a lot of Bad Forces were exerted on the wing--and our beautiful composite wing layup buckled pretty badly. See those wrinkles? Those are caused by the Bad Forces put on the wing by the aileron flutter. As the more experienced members of the team set about the very delicate task of repairing and reinforcing our wing in anticipation of reflying our last mission and shaving a few more seconds off our time, the rest of us found lunch at Chipotle and then camped the scoreboard for updates. Eventually it refreshed, and there we were--with our punishing weight of 4.66 pounds balanced out by our excellent mission score (in fact, the highest mission score), we sat at a solid fifth place, ten points ahead of Penn State. Performing surgery on Corn Dog. We attempted a reflight later that afternoon, but our wing couldn't take it--as soon as we finished one lap, that uncomfortable buzzing sound returned and Adam quickly turned Corn Dog around and landed it before it exploded in flight. This time it was the other aileron that failed. We called it a wrap and spent the rest of the afternoon huddling in the wind and watching the other teams fly (and in many cases, crash) their planes between spats of rain and thunder. We're very happy with our fifth-place finish, but we also took home a few lessons from the competition. Predominant is the fact that, though Corn Dog was designed well and constructed beautifully, it was way too heavy--and therefore lost out to lighter planes that didn't perform as well on the missions. Corn Dog was a very structurally solid plane (hence why it's still in one piece), but that meant that Corn Dog was conservative. Planes that pushed the envelope a little more, using less power and less structure and flying a little less stably, gained more from the decreased weight than they lost in performance. The University of Southern California, for instance, had a mission score only 80 percent of ours--but since their plane was less than half the weight of Corn Dog, and mission score is divided by weight, USC finished with in first place with a whopping 407.24 while we settled in fifth with a meager 210.87. And so we packed up Corn Dog and came home to MIT. We're going to be bringing our A-game next year, though--so be prepared. Corn Dog, Jr. is on its way. For now, if you're ever in building 33, stop by the hangar and pay a visit to Corn Dog, one of the sexiest RC planes to ever fly the Kansas winds.

Today was the major flight day for most of the teams at the Design/Build/Fly competition, and as hats flew and hair rippled in 30+ mph wind, it became clear that Wichita was dead-set on making sure flight was as difficult as possible. We wanted our plane, Corn Dog, to fly all three of our missions today--two speed missions and one untimed cargo mission--so that we would have an opportunity to re-fly tomorrow for better scores. However, when we arrived to the competition site, a brisk wind decided to settle in and loiter in the airfield for a day or two. Let's be clear--wind is bad for model planes. Wind means turbulence, extra drag, and a significantly decreased groundspeed when flying upstream. For instance, if your plane is designed to fly at 20 mph and the wind is 30 mph, your plane will take off and actually "fly" backwards.  The flight course Fortunately, Corn Dog was built for a cruising airspeed of about 70 mph, but it still took the extraordinary skill of our pilot, Adam (MIT alum and very experienced DBFer) to fly without crashing. We completed our first speed mission with a score of 7 laps in 4 minutes (tying with the best score), and we were only a few extra seconds short from setting the high score at 8 laps. When it was our turn to fly again, we flew the untimed cargo mission, carrying a three-pound payload for three laps. Unfortunately, the flight rotation didn't allow us to fly our third mission, so we'll be doing that tomorrow morning (and praying that the wind will take the morning off). Corn Dog on the move. Corn Dog weighed in on the heavy side at 4.66 pounds empty. Our extra weight nevertheless meant that we were one of the most stable planes at the competition; we spent all afternon between our flights watching plane after plane flip, crash, snap, or explode after being attacked by vicious winds at inopportune moments. One plane, for instance, ran out of power midair and came in for a glider landing--except the wind picked up right before touchdown, and the plane flipped over and shredded itself against the ground. Another plane got carried off-course by the wind and appeared to lose connection with the receiver, diving explosively into the lawn to the sound of a collective grimace from the crowd. At the end of the day, however, score is divided by aircraft weight--and as the live scoreboard updated throughout the day, we found our score trailing behind those of planes with net weights around 2 pounds. For comparison, Corn Dog's battery pack alone weighs 1.5 pounds. Here are the weights of the top three airplanes at the end of today: University of California, Irvine: 2.86 lbs San Jose State University: 2.04 lbs University of Southern California: 1.88 lbs Despite having the same mission scores as these teams, Corn Dog had over twice the weight, so we checked in at 13th place (that's with the zero score for the mission we didn't get to fly yet). Since Corn Dog is so fast, we're anticipating doing awesome on the third mission, and hoping to have enough time to refly our first mission and bump our score up to 8 or maybe even 9 laps. Given our weight, we're shooting for somewhere in the vicinity of a respectable fifth-place finish. Wish us luck and favorable weather :)  Corn Dog in flight, heading upwind. Overall, we're very happy with our performance--and other teams are noticing how beautiful Corn Dog is, too. DBF really fosters a super-friendly atmosphere, and we got into a lot of long conversations with other teams about our construction process. We were one of the few teams to build our plane pretty much entirely out of composites (big thanks to our sponsors and to the wellspring of resources that is MIT AeroAstro)--most of the other planes were made out of monokote (which is sort of like plastic saran wrap, but sturdier) stretched over balsa wood skeletons. Some common questions we got: What's the fuselage made out of? Three layers of Kevlar.  Was it expensive? Very. What are the wings made of? Two skins made of insulation foam and laid up with carbon fiber and fiberglass, then joined together sandwiched around a carbon/foam-core spar. It makes for a nice sky-blue wing that clashes wonderfully with the mustard color of the Kevlar fuselage. How did you steer the plane in the taxi mission? We have two propellers, so differential thrusting gave us plenty of turn control. How heavy is it? Too heavy. 4.66 pounds. (Usually elicited a sympathetic nod and something along the lines of "Yeah...weight tends to creep up on you unexpectedly.") Can we touch it? No. Final note: I'd like to give a shoutout to the team from USC, who had all their female members in hot pink shirts with TEAM GIRL on them. It's a great way to call attention to sexism in STEM and at least put that awareness in people's minds. Not to mention it looked fabulous--I'm beginning a campaign to put the entire MIT team, male and female, in hot pink My Little Pony-themed tank tops for next year's competition. Rainbow Dash would be proud. Corn Dog is cute, and so are we. --Allan I am sitting in the coolest little corner of our courtyard I've ever seen wearing shorts and a tank top.  The temperature is well into the sixties, and the music is blasting from the EC speakers sending a beacon out to prefrosh, welcoming them to our home. This is CPW. I already wrote a pre-CPW post, and this is my CPW update, informing you all about how incredible this experience is, and how grateful I am to live in a place this awesome. I woke up early this morning, 8am, for EMS drills, and although I was tired, I don't regret a second of it.  I love learning more about how I can help people, and I've had so many great ideas about how to spread our help across campus. More on that some other time, it's CPW! CPW has included so many different events, from tree swinging to cat petting to shanti-town building and more!  Here are some pictures of our adventures!      	And as promised, there was a Tim hack!!  Tim the beaver got to play the role of Miley Cyrus this weekend, on a wrecking ball!   	The prefrosh were very excited, but Galileo was not impressed, as usual.  	In other news, like I mentioned in my last post, the theme for East Campus' CPW this year is "The Great Depression." On Thursday we celebrated the Roaring Twenties with food and rich things, and then on Friday the prefrosh smashed a sign labeled "Stock Market" with sledge hammers.  After that, they built a giant box fort from the ruins of the stock market crash. It was beautiful. I am sitting inside of it right now! I hope we can keep it.     	When I was not occupying the fort, Fuzzy W. '14 was Trader Jack, handing out candy and other goodies to prefrosh and upperclassmen who answered his unusual questions correctly.  	As usual, the grills were fired up and ready to hand hundreds of prefrosh and MIT students burgers, as well as dye their hair!  	Every Friday at 5pm, East Campus has a tradition called Friday Afternoon Club, or FAC. Each week, a new hall is responsible for providing some sort of food substance for our dorm, and serving it in the dormitory lounge, Talbot.  Each year during CPW, Putz, or second west, is responsible for doing the infamous "CryoFAC," where they make liquid nitrogen ice cream for us and all the preforsh. It was awesome!   	While this was all happening, our campus was infiltrated by the enemy! Caltech students appeared on campus in a crowd - and we greeted them with ice cream and happiness!  They were sponsored by Caltech alumni to fly out here during our CPW to pull a very creative hack - they set up stations around campus and handed out mugs that normally looked like plain MIT mugs, but when heated they said "Caltech - the Hotter Institute of Technology." We were very impressed by this, and I personally gave them a tour of East Campus! They loved our culture and cats, and hopefully next year we can go visit them during their prefrosh weekend and mess with them in a similar way! It was really fun hanging out with them, and they even gave me a mug as a thank you for giving them a tour! Thanks Caltech!    	Caltech even got to go cruft smashing!  	Our freshmen even created some fun CPW events for everyone on the fly, such as tube races/battles/funtime.  	Meanwhile, inside talbot...   	At the end of the night, some of my friends and I ventured over the Spring Greater Boston Invitational Songfest, where all of MIT's awesome a cappella groups sang their hearts out! It was incredible and hilarious and so much fun to watch! 10-250 was filled to the brim with prefrosh, parents, and excited MIT students!  Here are some of my blurry pictures of the event. BUT! Fun fact! I'm buying a real-person camera soon, so no more blurry phone pictures! Hopefully by my next blog post, all my pictures will be beautiful, instead of only the ones containing cats!    	After a cappela, I walked home among the crazy prefrosh, excited for a night full of excitement, and of course, the Meet the Bloggers event! The event went lovely - the room was filled with bloggers, Petey, pie, coconut water, and lots of excited prefrosh! I even got a really cool Blogger shirt with my avatar on it! It was a little strange at first, but we quickly went into conversations about CPW, life at MIT, dorm culture, and more!  I even gave a bunch of them some tasty tangerines at the end! 	CPW is awesome. Everything is awesome right now at MIT, even if we have tons of work next week and this past week.  Seeing excited prefrosh brings all us students extreme joy and excitement about this awesome place we live and study in.  We hack, we punt, we tool - we live, we breathe, we MIT. And sharing this with prefrosh is so amazing, it really is hard to put into words. 	Each night, my prefrosh, Molly, and I have passed out, exhausted from the day but excited about the future and happy about where we are and where we will be. 	As usual, here is a picture of Galileo to end this post with. He is also extremely exhausted from all the excited prefrosh who have come to visit him!  	This is East Campus, this is MIT. This undescribable feeling is home :) Remember, kids, consent is sexy--so ask for permission before touching somebody else's airplane. This is important when you have 80 teams and their airplanes stuffed into a single Cessna hangar. There's the same sort of packed, nervous atmosphere that a hackathon has, but with airplanes. One-propeller airplanes and two-propeller airplanes. Big, long, tubular airplanes and boxy nugget-shaped airplanes. Airplanes with two fuselages and airplanes with two tails. See-through airplanes and colorful checkerboard airplanes. One airplane even had a shining coat of red-velvet glitter paint.   With the airplanes come airplane geeks. As everyone paraded their airplane into the hangar, it was common to overhear good-natured conversations about preferred manufacturing processes, questions about materials, and compliments about everything from the landing gear design to the paint job. Sometimes people get enthusiastic and want to touch each others' airplanes. This is kind of uncomfortable for everyone involved--imagine if you spent six months carefully crafting the perfect airplane and someone puts their grubby hands all over it. Not cool, especially for an airplane as special as our Corn Dog (so named for its Kevlar-yellow fuselage).  We're in Kansas for the Design/Build/Fly competition, and after unpacking our mobile laboratory and assembling our plane last night, we caught a few hours of sleep and crawled out of bed this morning at 6 AM. One group loaded up suitcases and headed off to the competition site, while the other took our airplane out to an RC field for some last-minute flight testing.   At the competition site, every team was given a taped-off area about 7 feet square to set up shop. While we unpacked all our suitcases and toolboxes, the teams around us sneaked awkward glances at our area and our conspicuous lack of an airplane. "The MIT team looks like they're all freshmen," muttered one of our neighbors. Meanwhile, we muttered to each other about the demographic makeup of the competition. "I forgot how much of a sausagefest DBF is," said one of our upperclassmen. "I think we're the only team that has more girls than guys." She had a point--the MIT team is in the extreme minority, if not unique, for having a female captain, and we were also one of the few teams not comprised largely of white males. Nevertheless, there was still a fair amount of diversity; one of our neighbors was a good-natured team from Tel Aviv that we quickly befriended, and across the room, a team from Hong Kong and a team from the United Arab Emirates hung their flags next to each other on the wall.    Meanwhile, our flight testing team had discovered that our airplane's center of gravity was too far forward. This meant delays. The first part of the competition is a "tech inspection," where the airplane is inspected on the ground to make sure everything is built to specifications and won't explode on takeoff. We were nineteenth in line, and as team 17 was called our flight testing team finally arrived with our plane. We ran into the parking lot to finish final assembly and march our plane into the hangar just in time for tech inspection. Final assembly in the parking lot   Tech inspection entailed a detailed checklist for our plane electronics, checking that the payload fit into the payload bay (left), and testing the radio connection and controls (right). After a nerve-wracking twenty minutes, we ticked all the boxes and carried Corn Dog lovingly to our workspace. We then headed out to Sonic (a drive-in burger restaurant) for lunch, where I ate a chicken sandwich and possibly the best limeade I've ever had in my life.   When we returned to the competition, it was time for Corn Dog's first test: the taxi mission. The airplane had to taxi (roll without taking off) across forty feet of corrugated roofing surface, and we watched nervously to see if our landing gear was up for the job.     Corn Dog, being the amazing plane we built it to be, passed the taxi mission with flying colors (or rather, rolling colors), and we headed back into the hangar for some more tune-ups and adjustments in anticipation of our first flight mission. Unfortunately we ran into some difficulties with our electronics and decided we weren't ready to fly today, so tomorrow (Saturday) we'll hopefully be flying all three of our flight missions. We fixed our bugs, headed to Olive Garden for a well-deserved dinner, and then called it a night.  Stay tuned for more pictures of Corn Dog (in flight!) and reports of our competition progress. Wish us luck for our flight missions tomorrow, that we may bring glory to the Institvte :) Allan We're in a hotel room and we're watching Men In Black (preceded by Aviator and Family Guy) while assembling our airplane to drown out the raucous men out in the parking lot blasting loud country music.  While all you sprightly prefrosh came rushing into MIT for the one and only Campus Preview Weekend, the MIT Design/Build/Fly (DBF) team was in lab, packing up and headed out to Wichita, Kansas for the 18th Annual AIAA DBF competition. Our plane, having been shipped last week in a big wooden crate carefully lined with soft things and packing foam, was waiting for us.    (You'd be surprised how many people want to lick our airplane. It's pretty sexy.) What, you might ask, is DBF? DBF is exactly what its name sounds like--a team of students designs, builds, and flies a remote-control aircraft to fulfill a number of mission requirements, and do it better and faster than all the other teams. It's about as hands-on as aerospace engineering gets, from the initial design brainstorming to the hours of mixing epoxy and building composites out of kevlar, carbon fiber, and insulation foam. This year, the design theme is "backcountry rough field bush plane." The plane simulates a medical plane for carrying cargo (1-pound 6-inch cubes) as well as a combination of four blocks simulating medical attendants standing next to patients on gurneys. The plane also has to be able to taxi for 40 feet on corrugated roofing. The theme is different every year--two years ago, the mission requirement was to carry 2 liters of water to a 100-meter altitude and then dump it out of the airplane like an aerial firefighter.  The MIT DBF team works out of the Gelb Lab in the basement of Building 33 (take a tour if you're on campus!). It's decked out with all your standard machining machines (mills, lathes, a waterjet), as well as two wire cutters for cutting insulation foam and one CNC foam cutter for more finicky foamcutting. DBF has a closet full of rolls of kevlar, carbon fiber of all different weaves and weights, bottles of epoxy and rolls of adhesives, plus all sorts of other knicknacks, tools, and materials needed to build and fly airplanes. Molds for our fuselage, wings, and tails. Vacuum pumps for composite layups. Motors and propellers and electronics galore.  If the MIT DBF team goes to Kansas, though, we take our lab with us. As of 6:00 AM this morning, the Gelb Lab has gone mobile. We've packed pretty much all our tools (sanding bars, drills, dremels, soldering irons, razor blades, etc) into our check-in luggage and our carry-ons, as well as enough backup parts and materials to rebuild our airplane three times over in case it spontaneously combusts or lawn-darts into the ground. Here we are waiting for the subway:  The TSA probably had a lot of fun going through our bags of chemicals, batteries, and cutting implements. When we arrived in Kansas a subway ride, two airplanes, and a layover in Chicago later, I realized that I'd forgotten it was possible for the weather to be over 50 degrees. It's a simmering 70 degrees here--t-shirts and shorts and even sunscreen--and no signs of changing much over the weekend, either. It's hot, hot, hot. We loaded up our suitcases into rental cars and drove over to our hotel, a sunny Days Inn by the highway, where we picked up our finished airplane and lovingly uncrated it from its wooden womb.    We then promptly unpacked our laboratory from our suitcases and set up shop. We had an airplane to assemble. The bathroom turned into a dremeling station (and soon became appropriately covered in blue foam dust), while the beds were repurposed as lab tables.       We'll be up early tomorrow morning to flight-test our baby once its fully assembled.  Stay tuned--because I'll be liveblogging on our progress every day this weekend to keep y'all posted about how awesome our airplane is. I'll be publishing some flight pictures of the plane very very soon :)  With love from Kansas, Allan When people ask me where I grew up, I hesitate for a moment before saying Orange County, California. I was born in Kalamazoo, Michigan, but I moved before the memory making parts of my brain could actually store any reliable information. I have one memory of me crying in the kitchen while my parents try to feed me coconuts, but this is of questionable veracity. My family then relocated to Carmel, Indiana, a city just north of Indianapolis where I spent my days eating Steak n Shake and fishing in the lake by our house. Is it important to this story that I tell you my neighbor Ed used to be a professional clown? Absolutely not. But now you can say that you know someone who had a clown for a neighbor. You know, if that ever comes up in conversation or something. While some might say that I spent my formative years in Orange County, Id like to think that the years leading up to my second grade move to California played no small role in getting me to where I am today. At the very least, it was the source of quite a few memorable experiences, and even some seemingly unmemorable experiences that have somehow managed to weasel their way into my permanent memory. This spring break, I went to Chicago with my family for a weekend. As we drove to our hotel, I looked out the window and watched as miscellaneous shrubbery and nondescript store fronts whizzed by. We were in a new city, and there were a hundred different places we could have gone first: the Sears Tower, Wrigley Field, or even the Shedd Aquarium. Noticeably absent on this list was Meijer, the local mid-west grocery store and the very first stop in our weekend vacation. I had been the one to suggest a stop at the grocery store I remembered so fondly from my childhood in Indiana. Not because I had a strange affinity for produce and breakfast cereals, but because of something I like to call The Lobster Incident. The Lobster Incident, my friends, begins with Young Krystals fascination with the massive lobster tank in the seafood section of Meijer. She particularly enjoyed watching the armored crustaceans frolic in the bubbling waters, so one fine day, she begged her parents to let her stare at the lobsters. Having gotten her wish, she proceeded to smush her face against the glass and ooh and ahh at the marvelous creatures. Of course, as we all know now, lobsters in seafood tanks are the opposite of interesting. With the poor animals on the brink of death, present day me doesnt find their lack of liveliness surprising. This revelation soon dawned upon Young Krystal and she realized that seafood lobsters were not, in fact, the most riveting attraction at Meijer. So, bored and brazen, she wandered off into the wilderness of the supermarket, intent on seeing the sights and discovering uncharted aisles filled with exotic goods. Young Krystal had gone where no Young Krystal had ever gone before and soon found herself lost in the aisle of disposable cutlery and dinnerware, her parents nowhere to be found. To make a long story short, a store employee found Young Krystal, probably bawling in a corner somewhere, and had to call her parents over the store intercom. The present day me now stood in front of the lobster tank in the Chicago Meijer, wondering how on earth I had ever thought a handful of motionless lobsters, claws clamped shut by rubber bands, were interesting. Recalling memories and reliving memories are two entirely different things. Before, every time I thought about The Lobster Incident, I remembered with fondness how awesome the lobsters were, how scary and confusing the winding aisles were, and how foreign shelves of cutlery could really seem. More than ten years later, I stare at the lobsters and think: Wow, Id rather watch a potato grow mold. I peruse the aisles and realize how straight and organized they are. I gaze upon foreign shelves of cutlery and  well actually I dont usually gaze upon foreign shelves of cutlery. Thatd be weird. I wonder why I remember so clearly the lobsters laying still at the bottom of the tank, or the rows upon rows of paper and plastic plates, but I have no clear memory of crying, of being escorted away by an employee, or of what must have been a joyous reunion with my concerned parents, arguably the most traumatic parts of the story. The most important parts are a blur but the strangest details remain. We dont get to choose what moments we forget, and which we get to keep. Even those that are stored in some nook or cranny in our memories arent always the same when we revisit them in real life. Campus Preview Weekend for me was a chance to create a real first impression of an institute that I could potentially spend the next four years of my life at. I hadnt committed yet and was still torn between MIT and another school. The funny thing is I cant seem to recall much from the four day weekend extravaganza. Like The Lobster Incident, there are moments that I remember clearly, and those that seem to have faded away. There was the overwhelming bustle of the activities midway, during which I was amazed at the numerous student groups manning booths and trying to interest pre-frosh in the extracurricular side of MIT. There was liquid nitrogen ice cream in the evening outside of the Z-center, current students clad in protective rubber equipment and swirling clouds of white being stirred up by our shuffling footsteps. There was learning how to use an electric drill for the first time in East Campus as rotating troupes of pre-frosh and East Campus residents pitched in to build a tree-house-fort-thing that was pretty darn awesome. Not everything at CPW is directly related with getting to know the campus, culture, and people better; some of it really is just for the fun of it. But its a great opportunity to experience things in person and make impressions that will hopefully encourage you to join us here at MIT. For those of you who havent made a decision yet, Id encourage you to go out of your way to form a concrete impression. Dont make my mistake and cruise through CPW without paying any attention. I let things happen however they may and I dont think I got the most out of CPW. While it certainly is a weekend to have fun, its also a time preview the campus and for some, facilitate an important decision. Weeks afterwards, I was still agonizing over my decision and my memories were already fading. If academics are at the crux of your decision, go to some classes tomorrow, and ask the students here about classwork, psets, professors and anything you can think of; we are more than happy to answer your questions! If you like sports, make sure you check out the Z-center and go to the athletics fair where you can talk with coaches or other student-athletes. Youre going to have fun no matter what. So many people have put their time and effort into making CPW the awesome event it is every year. But if I could go back and change one thing about my CPW, I would have talked to more people and asked more questions (although eating more liquid nitrogen ice cream would be a close second). Theres only so much you can get out of reading brochures and eating free food. Reliving the few memories now that I made at CPW is like reliving The Lobster Incident again over spring break. A new perspective has changed the way I view things. While Pre-frosh Krystal at CPW was intimidated by the sheer magnitude and energy of MITs campus, Present Day Krystal doesnt think its so scary anymore. Despite all of the pset horror stories and exam day nightmares that I remember being casually tossed around during CPW, its actually pretty awesome here. Ive had time to come to terms with the ups and downs of college life so now the winding hallways dont seem so hopeless, the strangers milling around dont seem so distant and unapproachable, and the classrooms and professors dont seem so daunting. Have fun. Eat food. Be awesome. By the end of this weekend, youll have a bucketful of memories to share with everyone, all hopefully more interesting than a bunch of lobsters sitting around waiting to get eaten.  I cant believe its been a year since I first delved into the MIT campus for a 3-day Campus Preview Weekend.  Suffice it to say that those three days felt like the longest three days of my life. My total sleep count over that weekend was in the single digits and I still remember a lot. My adrenaline was at an all-time high, fueled by the Institue's atmosphere of absolute energy. I remember a large bouncy castle and upperclassmen being dunked in water. I remember hugging Tim the Beaver and pulling my first all-nighter talking to amazing people. I remember my host, who hugged me on sight, and I remember the utter feeling of overwhelming joy as I treaded this new and strange and exciting environment. I remember a cool robot demonstration and I remember more liquid nitrogen ice-cream events than I really should! But despite how much of MIT I soaked in, I only covered a pinprick of what was in store for us. And to everyone whos going to be here over the next few days for CPW, I can promise you that getting pulled into its amazing pulse will be almost effortless. It takes a life of its own, and kind of sucks you in. But youll also need to be proactive. I found meticulously planning what events to attend particularly unhelpful, because I realized that just taking a bunch of steps in some random direction led me to some new place with some ongoing event far more exciting than what I had originally planned. That said, do go through your CPW booklet, which should contain literally dozens of pages of events spread out over 3-4 days! Find events that get you super-excited and go see them, but dont overplan. CPW was one of the most memorable weekends of my life, so much so in fact, that for the rest of this week, I am no longer Vincent Anioke, MIT Freshman. I am now Jason Hernaka, bespectacled, clueless prefrosh from Uganda, and Ill try to see how many prefrosh events I can sneak my way into, before my cover is blown and Im kicked out in some barrel. And now I present some wonderful advice (from wonderful current students at MIT) about CPW, as well the events going on in my dorm, Random Hall! There are tons of exciting ones so come check us out, and worry not if you get lost. The brave soldiers of Random have drawn paths leading from the Student Center to the abode that is Random Hall. Beyond our mystic doors, you will find the Ancients, sage-eyed and grinning, their arms stretched, to welcome you into a new and exciting world. --- Katie B. '15 1. If you pay for food at any point, you're doing it wrong.2. If you're asking yourself, "Should I go to Thing X?" the answer is always yes. Events > sleeping.3. Try things you've never done before, and try things you're not sure you'll like; MIT is all about new experiences! Elizabeth K. '14Dont stress over not being able to do everything. Its a life skill youll have to get used to if you come to MIT. :)Also, dont forget to sleep, as much as people pressure you to do ALL THE THINGS. Sleep is important. Rebecca L. '17I didn't know housing lottery was a thing and hence paid zero attention to dorms. This is a bad idea. Pay some attention to which dorm you like, so you can think about where you might want to lottery. At the same time, don't worry a ton about it because fyre and rex. Kate T. '16Check out ALL the dorms! Even if you fall in love with one and all you want to do is spend ALL your time there, you need to keep your options open. If you do end up in your first choice, you'll have a better idea of what your other friends' living groups are like. If you don't get into your first choice dorm, you'll know what other dorms would be a good fit for you and where you would be happy your first semester (if not your entire time at MIT) :) Katie S. '17Thoroughly look over all the events in advance. Schedule your CPW time, but be flexible. Also, get your parents to go to boring but informative events, and go to the fun ones instead. Try make it to a lot of the different dorms and get tours (this will be much better than trying to figure out which dorm you want later, with just the online information). Also, really talk to the people who live in each dorm about what it's like. Also, even if you're not planning on living in an east side dorm, you should visit them to see some of the awesome murals they have. Andrea L. '14Have fun!Try to think about if you want to be like people you are meeting in 2 or 4 years. The people you surround yourself with shape who you become. --- Meanwhile, brewing at Random Hall... Feel the magic this weekend. AHHH CPW!!! Was the name of my last blog post I wrote prior to CPW last year, and it is, once again, that time of year! This year I'd like to make it Q&A styled, where I answer some questions that you might have about this exciting weekend! Feel free to post any additional questions you have in the comments section below, and I will do my best to answer them as soon as possible! How do you decide which events to attend? I know that it gets confusing with the over 200 events listed on the CPW schedule, but you will decide as you go along.  You might be so excited that you want to go through the CPW booklet and highlight every event you want to attend or star each event for every day on your phone so you don't miss a thing (I actually did that) - but relax! Take advantage of every second of CPW by meeting your prospective classmates and doing things with them that you can both enjoy.  Some of my best friends at MIT are the ones that I met at CPW and during orientation/rush, and I remember the fun I had with them more than the specifics of the events that we took part in. My parents are worried about me going to CPW by myself. How do I make them feel assured that I will be okay? I went to CPW alone as a prefrosh, and my agreement with my mother was that I would check in with her via text or phone each day.  I also gave her the number of my host in case she couldn't get in contact with me. If that isn't enough for your parents, you can tell them that MIT has a 24/7 student-run ambulance service filled with volunteer student EMTs, and we are awesome.  We also have MIT Medical right here on campus, which has a walk-in urgent care center, available each day 7am-11pm, in case you are not feeling well.  Additionally, each dormitory has its own collection of Medlinks, which is another student run organization that connects students to MIT Medical by providing over the counter medication and bandaids, as well as other emergency care materials.  If you ever do not feel well or get hurt during the weekend, there is a huge support system here at MIT to help you out.  You can always call the MIT emergency line at 617-253-1212 if you do not feel safe or are in an emergency at any time during the weekend.  If you cannot find a Medlink wherever you are, try to make your way to East Campus and ask for me, Array. I'm a Medlink here in East Campus, and I'd be happy to try my best to heal you :)  How should I approach CPW if I have already ComMITted to MIT versus if I am still considering other schools? (Question submitted by Barbie D. '17) If you have already ComMITted, congratulations! If not...  But in all seriousness, if you have comMITted, focus the weekend on exploring each of the dorms.  Make it your goal to visit an event or party at every dorm, and get a feel for if you fit in well with the culture there. Talk to different upperclassmen and ask them where they live, and do your best to meet as many people as possible, especially your future classmates! Like I said, some of my best friends here at MIT are the ones I met during CPW, such as my friend Emma S. '16, who I make a point to see at least twice each semester even though she lives really far away in Simmons. If you have not comMITted, make it a point to check out the resources that MIT has to offer. Perhaps try attending a class or go to some information sessions for specific programs you are interested in, and try to see how well MIT is a fit for you academically and culturally.   How do I get around campus? What if I want to go somewhere off campus? (Question submitted by Alyssa H. '17) Alyssa H. '17 told me to "tell them where Pika is."  During her CPW last year, she got lost walking to Pika late at night in the cold, and was unsure how to use the MIT shuttles to get back to campus.  She thinks that she is defective for not knowing how to get around Cambridge, but she is not!  I still get lost getting to Pika, which is a co-ed independent living community here at MIT that has awesome events and is a ton of fun to hang out at.   My answer to this is to go to your mobile app store on your phone and download the MIT Mobile app: For Android/Google Play For IPhones This App is MAGIC!  I used it so much during CPW and rush, and it is how I get around campus even today when I am confused about what building I should be in or what bus I should be taking. It gives you up-to-date schedules of the shuttles that are running around campus, such as the Saferide shuttles that run at night, which so happen to go to Pika!  If you do not have a smart phone, I highly recommend finding someone who has one and sticking by them during your time at CPW, because it is really helpful! Additionally, if you find yourself lost and scared at anytime during CPW, call the MIT Police. They are extremely helpful, and they are there for you always, especially if you feel unsafe in any way. Here are some screenshots of the magical application:  How much sleep is the right amount of sleep? (Question submitted by Elena B. '17) Elena B. '17 claimed that she often heard advice from upperclassmen saying that "if you're sleeping enough, you're doing CPW wrong!" However, I have to disagree with that statement to an extent.  There are things going on during CPW at all hours, and it can be overwhelming at times when deciding to miss out on events in order to try and get some sleep.  My advice is to do what feels best for you.  My friend Jake I. '16 and I got so tired at one point during CPW that we just got angry and aggravated at the smallest things, and it got to the point where CPW just wasn't as much fun as it would be with more sleep. So we put away our red bulls from the night and got a good few hours of sleep, which made us feel a lot better. About 4 hours of sleep was about right for me during my CPW.  I stayed awake using energy drinks (my CPW was my first energy drink experience!), and spent the time with my new best friends exploring the Institute in any and every way that we could, and I don't regret it one bit. But your body is different from mine which is different from every other student who goes to MIT and who will be at CPW, and therefore you will need a different amount of sleep from other people. If someone is telling you that you cannot sleep but all you feel like doing is sleeping, go to sleep! You will feel a lot better once you have gotten sleep and you will be able to enjoy the CPW experience a lot more than if your brain is deprived of rest and unable to comprehend anything that is going on. If I am totally in love with one dorm, should I spend more time there? Or should I focus on exploring the other dorms? (Questions submitted by Elena B. '17 and Sebastian G. '17) Like I said, try to go to at least one event at each dorm. But if you go to an event at a dorm and realize that it is your favorite place in the world, I recommend spending the bulk of your time at that dorm.  For example, as a prefrosh, I found that I really fit in at East Campus and Senior House.  After attending events at every single dorm, or at least walking in to each dorm, I spent the rest of my weekend in the East Campus and the Senior House courtyards, trying to figure out which one was a better fit for me.  After all, when you fill out your housing preferences, you have to rank each dorm from first choice to last choice, so you better have a good idea of what each dorm is like so that you can rank them in a not-so-random fashion. How much time should I spend with my host? (Question submitted by Elena B. '17) This is a fantastic question, and one of the reasons why it is a part of the host-matching questionnaire you filled out when you submitted your form that you are attending CPW.  How much time you should spend with your host depends on how you want to spend your CPW.  I barely saw my host during CPW because she was a double major and was extremely busy studying during the weekend, so I spend the weekend with my new friends exploring campus. Last year, I barely saw my prefrosh, Victoria P. '17, even though we were friends before CPW, because she went off to see all of the other dorms and ended up choosing to live in Baker house, which was a better fit for her and I know that she is very happy there today!  I want to make clear that we chose to be CPW hosts because we are excited to meet prefrosh and convince them to come to MIT, and we are here if you need us, but do not feel pressured at all to spend all of your time with us.  You can spend as much or as little time with your host as you would like, but make sure that you do some exploring on your own, too!  Most prefrosh will choose a more flexible option where they check in with their host each day, but are mostly on their own, and this is how I plan on leaving it with my prefrosh. However, if she wants to grab food together or go to an event together, I would be more than willing to do so.  And I am sure that your host feels the same way :) Should I go see what the classes are like? Or should I mostly go to non-academic events? (Question submitted by Elena B. '17) This goes back to the question of "what if I have already ComMITted?"  If you already ComMITted, then you will have four years to see what the classes at MIT are like, go have fun!  It might be a good idea to see what one class is like so you can feel more prepared for your freshmen year, but don't spend all your time on academics, focus on trying to find a living group that best fits you.   If you have not comMITted, then I highly recommend attending some academic events across campus.  Getting a feel for what MIT is like in the classroom and out of the classroom will give you a good idea of if MIT is right for you, and it should help you make your decision. Is CPW a lie? You might hear this rumor from time to time during the weekend. There will be whispers from upperclassmen across the courtyard, bitter from a week of tests and problem sets due. "CPW is a lie," they'll say.  And I disagree, to an extent.  CPW is a time when we MIT students get to show you the things that we love to do and would love to do on an every day basis if we could.  However, it is not a representation of what MIT life is like each day as a student who is hosed with tons of problem sets and exams and studying and labwork and more.  This doesn't mean that CPW is for nothing - you will learn about what MIT students are really like as people, and get a feel for which cultures you fit in with.  MIT can be extremely tough at times, but we like to use CPW and Rush (orientation) as times where we can explode from the inside out with our creativity and passion for what we study and where we live.  Some things about CPW do happen outside of this weekend - we often have burgers grilling in the courtyard of East Campus during the nice weather, and we occasionally enjoy (probably on a monthly basis) smashing old computer equipment and other cruft (usually maybe sometimes in the form of throwing it out windows).  We also have hair dyeing parties and various other carnivals during the year.  It just isn't every single day, like during CPW. Are upperclassmen scary? (Question submitted by William L. '16) Yes.  William L. '16 says that when he was a prefrosh, he thought that it was scary talking to upperclassmen, or current MIT students, about what it is like to go to MIT.  But now, he is extremely excited to talk to you, and "suck the happiness out of you."  He is kidding, don't worry. In all seriousness though, come and talk to us! We want to be your friends and we love MIT so much that we want to share our joy and experiences with you! Ask us questions, let us dye your hair, let us take you on tours of campus (I can show you where Baker house is, if you would like), and more! "Has anyone really been far, even as decided to use -- even go -- want to do look more like?" (Question submitted by Max J. '17) I don't understand Max, if you understand this please comment below and say mean things about him. How do I meet the bloggers? Connie H. '15 has a blog post regarding where you can find the bloggers around campus during CPW, but also you can come and meet all of us Friday on the third floor of the Student Center (W20) from 9pm-10:30pm.  We want to see you and talk to you! I'll even show you more pictures of cats if you want! What are some other "don't miss" events? (Question submitted by Elena B. '17) These are some of my favorites! I can't wait to meet all of you at CPW!  AHH CPW! Let me know if you want to come meet Galileo :) He is even more excited than me about CPW!  i'm from albany, california, which is a tiny square mile and a half next to berkeley, california. as a result, i say hella... hella. my life goal is to be on extreme couponing: all-stars. my other life goal is to avoid being on hoarders: buried alive. i... read more  see complete archives  When the CPW schedule came out  when I was a prefrosh 50000 years ago, I turned into a puddle of excitement. A puddle!  I tried to plan out a full itinerary and ended up with something like this:  ... and miserably failed at attending all the events I had hoped to be at. While this is not a guide to optimizing your CPW experience... here are a few things I wish I knew as a prefrosh! 1) Your host loves you, so try your best to get to know them! Remember that your host is fully aware of the commitment of hosting a prefrosh, so don't feel like you are a burden. However, you shouldn't plan on glomming onto your hostremember that campus is filled with hundreds of other prefrosh just like you, so it'd be a shame to not go out and meet them :) 2) The MIT Mobile application will help you navigate across campus and on the Boston side where you might find events from FSILGS. Download it and check it out! You can also use whereis.mit.edu for a simple Google Maps version of campus. Don't be afraid to explore - there are great events that are often a shuttle ride away. 3) You can catch up on sleep when you get home. Don't feel guilty for wanting to stay up and try everything. :) You've earned it! 4) CPW is still school for us! (unfortunately) If your host has classes on Thursday and Friday, or club meetings throughout CPW, or a bit of studying or problem sets to do for next week... then your host is indeed an MIT student! Don't fret and feel like they don't want to spend time with youthey are often trying their best to clear their schedule for you. :D ~~~~~~~ And if you want to find a blogger for some life guidance? Here's where you'll find us this CPW: I will be... Anna H. '14 will be... Rachel D. '16 will be...   Erick P. '17 will be...   Emad T. '14 will be...   And blogger or notdon't be afraid to ask a student tough questions if you're looking for deeper answers. Beyond our hopes that CPW is one of the craziest experiences of your life, we hope that it answers a lot of your questions if you do have a tough choice to make. My CPW host helped me understand why MIT was a good fit for me. :) Oh and... 5) Bring a pair of comfortable shoes you can walk, run and climb in. For uhh... exploring. One would think that after seven years in this office I would not be as excited about the start of Campus Preview Weekend (CPW). Yet, after all this time, I never cease to be thrilled to get to finally meet all of our admitted students and those parents who are on campus as well.  The first question I often hear from parents is, "what events should I attend with my child?" In truth, there won't be very many of them if you are each doing what interests you the most. With hundreds of options over the next few days, there are lots of things to choose from and parents will probably not want answers to the same questions that students will. That said, it's important to check in occasionally so I'd suggest you pick an event where you can meet up with your student each day (perhaps the CPW Welcome/Faculty Speaker event on Friday morning and the Closing Variety Show on Saturday evening) but mostly I hope you will encourage them do their own thing and know that it's good for you to do the same. Its the best way for them to figure out if they are comfortable and at home on our campus and the best way for you to be comfortable with them being here. I hope youll ask lots of questions. Its the way our students learn and will work well for you too. Current students are great resources so dont be afraid to ask them about their experiences. In addition we've enlisted the help of a great group of current students' parents called Parent Connectors. They'll be available throughout the weekend to address those issues that are most important to you, the parent, so don't be afraid to ask for their opinions...they know exactly how you feel since they were asking those same questions just a year or so ago. They are also easy to locate in their red Parent Connector polo shirts so keep a lookout for them. A great place to find a parent to talk to would be in the Parents Hospitality Lounge. Grab a cup of coffee or tea and chat with current MIT parents as well as other parents of MIT prefrosh. Also, learn about the MIT Parents Association and the Parent Connector Network from current volunteers and staff. I hope youll be open-minded during your visit with us. I have lived with current students and their life at MIT is somewhat different than mine was when I was here. I'm sure you'll feel the same way too. It's just not the way we remember it. I remember fondly my mothers first less than ecstatic comments in viewing my dorm when I was a student at MIT but for me it was the perfect choice for my four years at MIT. Bring comfortable shoes and a jacket or sweater and perhaps even an umbrella. Weather can change quickly in Boston, especially in the springtime, so you should be prepared for anything. Boston is a great walking city and I hope you'll take some time to see the environs around MIT as well the campus itself and the best way to do that is on foot. Even just a short walk along the river can be a nice break from all the events of the day. Have questions regarding your student's financial aid package or the financial aid process in general? There will be an open house Thursday, Friday and Saturday at Student Financial Services so you can stop in and get your questions answered. On Thursday and Friday there will be comprehensive presentations by Executive Director of Student Financial Services, Elizabeth Hicks. Parents and students are welcome to attend either of these programs on the hows, whys and whens of financial aid at MIT -- how your financial aid award was determined, when your supplemental forms are due, how to pay your balance, how to find on-campus student employment, and how your online student account will work and much more. But that is just the beginning... Events Panels & Sessions Ive named just a handful of the events created with you in mind for CPW and it really is just the tip of the iceberg. We'll provide you with a full schedule when you get here but to get a head start on your plans check out the online listings on our CPW site.  See you soon!  Last year, the admitted students of the Class of 2017 got invitations to Admitted Student Gatherings, social events for mingling with other prefrosh, current MIT students, and MIT Alumni. The one closest to me was hosted by the MIT Club of Northern New Jersey. As the only accepted MIT student in the immediate area, I was pretty excited to meet other 2017's in person...and to stuff my face with the alumni's homemade desserts! It was held at one of the alum's house and started with a typical question and answer session. A New Jersey MIT freshman had come from her spring break to tell us about experiences thus far at MIT, from astronomy classes to being on the fencing team to more general "time management tips". Afterwards was social hour, where I met some really cool alumni. Especially interesting were the alumni who majored in 6-2 Computer Science and Electrical Engineering, which I wanted as my major. It was amazing seeing how much the fields of computer science and electrical engineering had evolved over the span of just a few years. The gathering also got me really pumped me up as I began coordinating with my new NJ MIT friends what events we should do as soon as we got there.     This year, I got a similar email, but with one crucial difference:  My turn to come down during my spring break and be the MIT freshman with all the answers. My turn to be the "cool kid" on the block. They're the eager prefrosh who have questions about MIT life and can't wait to set foot on MIT at CPW. My turn to tell them about my experiences at MIT and what I've gone through so far. I began to wonder what kinds of questions they would ask. Would they ask about housing? The meal plans? Greek life? How to not rip out your hair while doing PSets? It's a good thing that my very job for the entire past semester was telling people about my MIT experiences. So I put on enough makeup to hide the bags under my sleep-deprived eyes and to mask the tolls that MIT stress had taken on me (just kidding!) and went with my mom and dad to the gathering on the Saturday of my spring break. The question and answer session itself was pretty casual. Two other MIT students were there with me: Ben Chazen and Liana Ilutzi (who I decree must only be referred to as Ms. President due to her status as President of the Class of 2017). We took turns tackling the various questions about meal plans, housing, dorm life, UROPs, and things to do for fun. One prefrosh asked how I balanced my work, sleep, and social life. My answer was "Simple. I do my work during the day, sleep during the night, and hang out with friends in my dreams." Afterwards we stuck around and talked to the different prefrosh before heading out. I had a fun time, and I definitely look forward to doing it again for the MIT Club of NNJ's other events.        I hope you enjoyed this post, but if if you prefrosh are so uncontrollably excited for CPW tomorrow that you temporarily forgot how to read words, I've been there.

One thing most of them have in common though are the scale and weight of the exams. Another non-trivial difference between academics at Cambridge and MIT is the way exams and grades work. MIT runs under a continuous assessment school of thought. Throughout the semester you'll take 1-3 tests + final and have quite a few problem sets/labs/papers that are continually assessing your knowledge. At Cambridge there is significantly less graded coursework. The supervision work I talked about last week is only graded for your benefit and doesn't contribute to your final grade. With that said though the supervisors provide reports where they predict how you'll do on the corresponding paper of the EXAMS. 1B Computer Scientists have 4 courses that do have graded coursework though. One thing to keep in mind for all of this graded coursework is that they are all based on ticks, a pass/fail system where it's all or nothing. And until early June that is all that is graded. Once June hits you take EXAMS. There are 4 papers that are each 9-10 questions long. You have 3 hours for each paper and choose 5 questions to answer on each one. What this means is that you can answer questions for subjects you're more comfortable with and ignore classes (*cough*ComputerGraphics*cough) all together. These four papers will collectively cover 20 examinable subjects of which 16 have been covered already. Compsci exams are June 2nd-5th. Luckily we have two hefty 5 week breaks to revise all this material, which is exactly what everyone does. Here's what a day revising looks like. It's crucial that I wake up early because while I won't BE productive for the next three hours, I'll definitely FEEL productive(arguably more important). Now that I'm awake I can hit snooze for an hour. After the umpteenth alarm goes off I'll finally muster up the power to roll out of bed and grab some breakfast making materials. I swipe open the curtains and let out a small groan as my eyes blink themselves awake. With bagels, a tea bag and some peanut butter in hand I make the small trek to the kitchen to start my day. Once breakfast is made I usually head back to my room to enjoy the actual eating portion. Because my hands are in use this is the perfect time to catch up on all the wonderful video content the Americans have released while I was sleeping. After that I'll watch an episode of whatever TV show I'm following (currently Samurai Champloo) and make the mistake of going on Reddit. A short time warp later. It's about this time that any feeling of productivity I felt for waking up early is completely gone. I'll usually glance over at my pile of papers  and desperately look for excuses to not start studying. A quick peek in the bathroom shows me that my body wash is going to run out! Well, I can't have that now, better get dressed and cycle down to Sainsbury's. Man, I'm feeling more productive already. Wait, is that Ernesto '15 over there! We still haven't planned our trip to Amsterdam, I wonder if he's busy. After a quick chat with Ernesto we've decided to plan the whole trip today. This is a day of productivity packed in a few hours, I'm so glad I was running out of body wash. I say my goodbyes, cycle back home and start to make lunch. 15 minutes later my delicious ramen is ready to be consumed. <See Eating Breakfast and Interneting> At this point all the feelings of productivity have washed away. I've realized that planning the trip was productive but it also means that I'll be out of comission for 3 full days. Time to start studying. But first I need to find some music/tv/movies for background noise. Everyone studies differently but this is how I prefer to do it. <See Eating Lunch and More Interneting> It's around this point everyday that I realize how much of the day has been wasted. Once I've made this realization I slack off a little bit more and make some final attempt to feel productive. I'll either go back to studying, start a blog post or take a walk. And then I'll hype myself up for the CRAZY amount of work I'm going to get done tomorrow. Well, if the day is shot anyway might as well watch another episode of Samurai Champloo. Need my beauty sleep to get up at 8 for the insane amount of work I'm going to get done.   And then repeat ad nauseum. At this rate I'll be ready for exams by late September. October at the latest. I know I used this joke on Facebook a few weeks ago. Forgive my lack of originality. If you were offered a place on our wait list in March, you should have received an email from us last Friday about completing the Wait List Form. Whether you wish to remain on MIT's wait list or not, please complete the form and submit it by April 25, 2014. In the meantime, be sure to enroll in another college/university by May 1 (even if it means making a deposit). There won't be further news on the wait list until mid-May, once we know how many students have enrolled and thus, how many more students we will be able to admit to the Class of 2018. If you have any questions about the wait list, refer to this post for some helpful tips and advice.  If you were wait listed, but did not receive an email with instructions, check to make sure it's not in your spam folder. Otherwise, send an email to admissions [at] mit [dot] edu with your name and Application ID and we'll get back to you. Two weeks ago was our Spring Break at MIT, and the halls of Tetazoo were empty.  The cats were begging for attention for the first time in what seems like forever, as their owners left them for hiking mountains or driving across the country or exploring caves. Yet I was here, at MIT, preparing myself for the UPOP Spring Team Training Camp.  UPOP, or the Undergraduate Practice Opportunities Program, is a program for sophomores that prepares us for success in the workplace.  Throughout the year, we have obtained guidance, support, and training in our internship searches and in preparation for the summer and the future.  UPOP also holds a week-long program for sophomores during IAP, however, since I trained to be an EMT during IAP, I could not attend the week-long program.  Instead, I attended a three-day program during Spring Break where I worked in a team with an MIT alum as a mentor to work on our teamwork skills. I really enjoyed working with my team during the week. Our group had seven people in it, one of which I knew prior to the program and five of which became my new friends.  Our mentor was really awesome - she was an alum from the class of '82, and she had a lot of really great input on our projects and various modules during the program. UPOP was Monday-Wednesday from 9am-5pm, so it did get a bit tiring, but the coordinators surely kept us off our feet and very involved.  We'd start off each day with announcements, where the coordinators, Bethany and Sharon, would yell "HEY UPOP" and we would yell back "HEY UPOP."  My group is the table in the middle, Table 3.  We named ourselves Team 2048, after the extremely addicting game. We even had a team chant going "Two-Oh-Four-Eight Who do we appreciate? ____" where ____ was either UPOP or the name of our mentor. I think it might have irked some of the other teams a bit, but it made us really happy. We had a good time working together during the week, and even coordinated our outfits for some events, like for our major presentation on the last day of UPOP.  We don't look very happy in that picture, but we did feel really passionate about what we were presenting about.  We chose to present on the issue of dorm security here at MIT, and about how the current program is inconsistent, and sometimes unfair, across the dormitories.  Last semester, I tried to bring a prefrosh into Simmons hall to see the dining hall, and security stopped me and told me that I was not allowed to enter the building with the prefrosh, even if I was on the guest list and the prefrosh had a non-MIT ID.  Many other people have had similar things happen to them or are experiencing new problems with our outsourced securities systems, and it is causing some distress among MIT students. Overall, our presentation went really well! We were proud of how we had worked together, and about the final product.  Kaylee B. '16 is an opinion writer for the Tech, and she might post something in the near future about what we presented on! We had fun with the other projects we worked on, which included negotiation workshops, presentation workshops, and more!  This is my friend Kaylee B. '16 being very passionate about our discussion. One of the coolest projects we worked on was creating the tallest building that we could out of foam and pencils.  We had a limited amount of money to buy a limited amount of materials.  The building needed to pass a "tilt test" with a water bottle at the top of it to make sure that it was "earthquake safe." In the end, our group passed the tilt test, but still lost terribly due to its height.  However, we had the prettiest design! This is our tower:  Here I am with Serena P. '16 and Caitlin H. '16 working on the tower:  And obtaining those materials wasn't that easy!  That's Kaylee B. '16 helping carry foam over from the store, also known as the Foam Dome and the Cut Hut.  We spent all our money on pencils and foam blocks.   However, we lost in the end to a team with a 70"+ tour.  Even though my team lost, we wanted to show our spirit and how grateful we were for mentor's help, so after the winning team passed the tilt test we did our team cheer and at the end we yelled "Marissa!"  However, a girl from the winning team yelled "You guys lost!" and laughed at us. I didn't think it was funny, it was mean. So congrats team four for winning that round, you guys did a great job! Except no congratulations to whoever shouted that.  Overall, UPOP was a lot of fun.  I made a lot of really great new friends, and some of them even came back with Kaylee and me to East Campus after the last day of UPOP for a tour of our halls!  Caitlin H. '16 and Zara P. '16 liked East Campus, and they also loved the cats, of course!  After UPOP was over, I headed back home to New York to see my family, which included my puppy, Boots!  I wished him a happy belated birthday. My little puppy is five years old now! In celebration of my dad and I becoming certified EMTs this year, my family went out to a really fancy dinner place, Insignia, with some gift cards my mom had received from co-workers during the holiday season.  Insignia was a Sushi Steakhouse, so with me being a vegetarian I was a bit worried that I would be stuck eating fancy salad (even though salad is super yummy).  However, the waitress suggested that I try a "watermelon steak," and it was so good!  It was one of the strangest and tastiest foods I've ever had.  It was grilled watermelon over steamed vegetables with a yummy balsamic-y glaze over the top.  I am definitely going to try it again! So next time you're at a barbeque and there's watermelon, try throwing it on the grill!  Apparently it is a thing! Overall, I quite enjoyed my spring break. It started off kind of shakey on the weekend, but it was a much needed break from the craziness that is MIT. And it was a great rest for the cats, who quickly became bored of us as soon as people started returning from their adventurous spring breaks.  All UPOP pictures were taken by the UPOP Marketing and Communications Officer, Jessica Jones. And psych! Happy April Fools Day! I didnt celebrate it in particularly grand style, but I do plan to give some of my friends heart-attack-worthy lies over the next couple of days. And this blogpost is all about the art of lying. We all know good lies contain a grain of truth, like how CPW shows that MIT is a series of nearly back-to-back all-nighters, except that events, games and making new friends are replaced with p-sets, p-sets and chatting with hosed friends. Well...dont take my word on that. Nah, actually, you probably can. Its been a few days since Spring Break ended, and the break was truly wonderful. Apart from spending a great deal of time writing new short stories, I saw and spent time with my mom. I hadnt seen her in nearly nine months, so I was shaking with all the excitement of an excited train guy howling about trains and then infinitely more. It was a beautiful week. Now, Im back to the usual battle with problem sets and stubborn, crashing codes. Taking breaks like this to write is always a cause for celebration.  And, on the surface at least, thats what this post is about. Fiction is the truth inside the lieStephen KingI like writing about MIT, about the tumbling rollercoaster rides and endless head-bashing we face against problem sets, about the students, about wondering if the Alchemist Statue will one day rise and kill us all. You can almost feel its venom building up like Voldemorts, just before he melodramatically shrieks, Avada Kedavra! at Harry Potter in the penultimate forest scene of the final movie. I see you, evil statue. I know your plan. But as much as I enjoy writing for the blogs, I spend the bulk of my time writing about imagined worlds, about heartbroken moms and bullied kids, depressed serial killers and cautious illegal immigrants. At this point, I must have written at least a hundred different stories, most of them unfinished. They kind of just sit impatiently in my Documents Folder, bidding me to hasten and complete their worlds. Except that each snippet of a plot I type up doesnt feel like a world Im creating. It feels like one I'm discovering. These people, with their dreams and their stories, escaped from some universe, a piece of a jigsaw puzzle Im privy to. And the more time I spend with them, the more pieces jump out; the more I begin to see where they want me to delve into. From memory, my earliest attempt at a story occurred in grade four. I wrote an 84-paged tale titled, The Cries of Emeka, a literary atrocity that spewed prose with all the harmony of brain-dead chimpanzees banging on drums. My saving grace existed in my cluelessness. I had no idea I was such a terrible writer, and thus, I wrote more frequently. Just before grade 7, I had my Star Wars phase, and was so awestruck by the movies that I instantly wanted to find a world like that. From this, Sagittarius was born. Sagittarius may be my most meaningful endeavor yet, one I began over six years ago, one that Ive barely scratched the surface of, as of today. I spent all of high school writing this six-part sci-fi series, about a planet called Sagittarius, one of many in a collection of star systems ruled by the Cosmotic Federation. Wha? Well, thats not really a good description, but as the plot tends to meander in all directions Im clueless on how to summarize it. I completed Sagittarius in grade 11. The first draft at least. I had written everything on paper (my boarding high school was very anti-laptop. And pretty much anti-anything that could be associated with batteries). At its completion, there were two thousand or more pages. Only two people had read the entire thing, and their inputs played much part in what feels like my formative years. After completing Sagittarius (the first draft at least), I decided to go on a writing hiatus. At several moments, writing had clashed with my academic work. Even at moments when missing classes to study for the IMO had me really hosed, I still gave large portions of my time to writing, and as drawn as I was to the art of having characters do stupid plot-convenient things (snerk), I knew I couldnt keep it up for long. Which was really just a stupid lie because as long as I wanted to keep it up, I could. And thus, the break following grade 11, when my family and I saw news of a kidnapping, when my parents began talking about it, something flew in. It was a man, bloody-faced and bound in ropes. I wasnt seeing him on the television. He was somewhere in my mind, writhing in agony. He was trying to say something, but I couldnt make much from his muffled croaks. And I instantly knew I wanted more. A new phase began. Over the course of months, I began to see more and more of the mans world, and the people around it. When I couldnt connect the dots floating in my head, I tried to force some connection, but as long as it didnt feel right, as long as it didnt feel natural, I refused to move on with it. By the end of my final year, I had enough of the pieces to begin drawing life into them, to begin dragging these people out of my head and flooding them into an empty 11KB Word Document. The writing process is, at its peak, a delightful and immersive process. Ive found that the more involved I was in a story, the more my heart and mind seemed to tie themselves around it. I remember writing a story two months ago about a family of illegal immigrants. I didnt know much about the issue as it related to the US prior to writing the story, but I had a little piece of it with me, and I was convinced that to discover the rest, I simply had to know more about the issue itself. Cue to a long, near-sleepless night spent on Wikipedia and government pages and blogs and mini-documentaries. And I suddenly knew what had happened to the characters in my head, what had to happen. The stories I write are typically darkI have no idea why; they just seem to mold onto the shapes of the vulgar and the sinister. And for this specific scene, I found something wrong with me. I was supposed to describe a deatha man close to the main character had met his end in a graffiti-ridden alleyway, his belongings stolen, his throat slit. And when the main character found out, as I typed up the words of his discovery and his shell-shock, I felt two layers. There was the exterior layer, the blank-faced me, just typing the words, just watching the scene play out from somewhere intangible. And then there was the interior layer, a blend of myself and the character. I could feel his horror. I could feel his pain. It was a kind of distant pain, hushed by the presence of the exterior, but it still felt raw. It still felt real. And as heartache was inflicted on this person that I was cared about, the words just bled onto the page. Yes, hes trying to say these things. No, he cant. Hes just standing there, paralyzed. His mouth is open and I can see it. I can see the people around him. I can feel the heaviness in the air, a toxic charged cloud that seems to hold everyones joints in stasis. And this is what writing fiction feels like. When writing about the serial killer, youre suddenly the serial killer. You see the victim from his excited eyes. You can feel his breath puffing up your throat and out your lips on this warm night. You can see why he has to do it, why the girl has to die. And you can feel him charging forward, his shadow winking in and out of a line of trees. And suddenly, you can feel the girl as he draws her up close. You can hear her screams as his knife comes down. You can feel the resistance as a cold blade meets the bone beneath warm flesh. And when youre the girls mother, standing in court and staring at the face of the killer, youve forgotten the wash of emotions that overwhelmed you as the girl died. You see nothing but a repugnant, hateful, disgusting man. Your grief and fury cant be expressed in enough words, but you can feel it and you can attempt to transmute it into letters. You can feel the impulse to reach for his face and break it. You see your girl, think of her smile just before she slipped out into the night. You remember how you almost called her backjust a thoughtless whim at the time (too cold out dear, just come back in and go tomorrow). But now, now, it could have been everything. The line between salvation and demise. Shes dead. Shes gone forever. And suddenly, youre not the mom, but an observer, riding the clouds and watching the lives of these people play out. And somehow, you know that theres a lot the mom doesnt know. You know that when she steps out of the court, a set of intricate dominoes will fall, dominoes set up by another person. You know that she will soon meet the same fate her daughter did. *** And when Im writing, the world around me just fades. People mutter, songs play, cars zoom by, but I dont know about any of that. I dont care. What matters now are the people and their world, a world Ive spent ages trying to piece together, to delve into, a world that I now understood well enough to talk to you about. I used to care about how good my stories were, how real my characters were. But I dont anymore. While I still try to take writing classes and soak up as much lessons of literature as I can, I never let the fear that my writing might suck stop me from typing the stories I want to type. But this wasnt always the case. *** The last huge piece of writing I typed up, over the course of my gap year, is titled, Whirlwind of Metamorphosis. Its set in Nigeria, and describes how a kidnapping initiates a series of increasingly worse events on a family. My cousin read it over Spring Break and wondered why so many awful things were happening. When we discussed it, I wasnt entirely struck by how many hopefully heartfelt compliments she had to offer, despite the overall morbidity of the characters situation. I was awestruck by how she talked about them the same way she could about people shed seen in the news, real people somewhere out there, facing real problems. And it took me a while to realize that even if she had thought differently, say, even if she had thought they were two-dimensional cardboard characters, spewing the kind of stereotypical crap we might expect people of their profiles to spew, it wouldnt matter. I always set to every story with the best of intentions. Flaws were more than inevitable; they were necessary. I had to be aware of their existence, but I wouldnt let them hold me back. I realized this when, halfway through Whirlwind of Metamorphosis, I stopped writing the story. I wasnt sure of its sense of direction. I wasnt sure of its artistic merit. It felt like a tumbling mess of words penned by the typical trite monkey with a typewriter. And so for two months, I did other things. I watched TV shows and solved math olympiad problems. I taught at my high school and transferred the contents of the home refrigerator into their true homemy stomach. I did anything but write. My mom wondered why. Shed known I was working up a story. Id actually told her some of the starting events. And she wondered why I wasnt writing anymore. When she realized that I wasnt jaded or burnt out, just afraid and uncertain, she went along the lines of Well, even if what you write makes no sense, its still several pages better than something that doesnt even exist. I did end up finishing the book. And it did end up getting accepted for publication.      On print, it came out to about 547 pages. ***Why did I start writing anything in the first place? Why do I decide to write anything?  I dont know. The answer my mind wants to give goes along the lines of: there are things my mouth cant utter that my hand can; there are feelings I cant voice to an ear that a page can hold in confidence. I write because I have something to say, if only to myself. And this feels right. But in all honesty, theres such an element of joy, of fundament, to writing. Its such a big and indispensable part of my life that the more truthful answer seems like: I have something to say because I write. Writing has been with me from the onset, and its empowered me to describe things that would have otherwise had no voicefrom intimate secrets to ghastly tales.  And to you, friend, still somehow reading, I know that theres something that makes you light up. Whether you can describe it or not, there are things that you just want to pursue and jump into with tidal fury. Things you love. Things you think you could love if you tried Pursue them. The more you do, the deeper into yourself youll seem to collapse. These things will tie themselves so deeply to you that their growth will mean yours. And when fear comes, gnarly, mutated, rising from the shadows, when you begin to get doubts, and when you begin to lose motivation, remind yourself that youre really doing these things for yourself. And why should it matter if they're imperfect or error-ridden? They're for you. When you're not thinking of others, you're able to enjoy them, and that's really what matters.  I dont know what the future holds. I dont know if Ill ever publish another book or if Im destined for a lifetime of rejection slips from apologetic publishing presses. But I know that no matter what, Ill always want to write.***  One of the academic differences between MIT and Cambridge is that instead of having recitations they have supervisions . A supervision consists of 1-3 students and a supervisor that is either a graduate student, who has some background with the course, or a professor/fellow. These supervisions are setup within your college (another system I'll talk about in a future blog) and are where a significant portion of learning happens at Cambridge. Here's a handy chart I threw together to show contact time at MIT vs Cambridge for IB Computer Scientists (it varies heavily based on year and course). But the difference doesn't end at class size or contact hours. Course work at Cambridge revolves around supervisions. Each supervision is paired with some form of work. This work could consist of an essay, pset style questions, or past exam problems. The goal is to finish the work and hand it in 24 hours before the supervision so that they have time to grade it and provide feedback. What actually happens in the supervision is largely dependent on the supervisor. And thus we get to the point of this post. Since coming to cambridge I've had a wide array of supervisors and I've noticed that there are seven types of supervisors/recitation leaders you'll encounter, each with their pros and cons. Disclaimer: All of the supervisors I've had this year have been absolutely wonderful and this post is just my poor attempt at a joke. Mostly. Major Trait: Can explain any subject with startling clarity. This individual is truly a cut above the rest. Every student who has had them will have a story of how given 20 more minutes they would've given a solution to the halting problem. You'll spend hours working on a problem only to have it explained in 5 minutes. But the supervisor doesn't usually stop there, they push you to fully understand the solution and be able reproduce the answer. When you're completely stumped in a lecture for a course that they are supervising, you stop taking notes because you know it'll make more sense when they teach it to you. You'll run into these supervisors once in a blue moon, treasure the short time you have and hope they'll supervise future courses.   Major Trait: Draws the most beautiful mathematical symbols you've ever seen.  This supervisor has one simple motto, there is no theorem, lemma or concept that isn't better understood. with a rigorous proof  While there is more than a grain of truth in this motto, you typically won't be examined on rigorous proofs. You'll come with questions about how to solve a specific type of question that's appeared in the last 8+ years' exams and you'll leave with 5 pages of rigorous proofs and no more knowledge on how to solve the question. Some people love these supervisors, others can't stand them, it all depends on your personal learning style.   Major Trait: Isn't held down by the shackles of a syllabus. This supervisor has taken their own spin on things. Ignoring the recommend supervision topics they decide to teach whatever they find most interesting.  While it's always relevant to the course and uses topics you have touched on, it'll take an interesting detour that isn't examinable. This supervisor is also hit or miss for students. This method of teaching is useful for those who understand the lectured material and would like to get a further understanding that's outside the scope of the class. On the other hand, learning material outside of the syllabus is frustrating when you don't already understand the lectured material.  Major Trait: Sees nothing wrong with thousands of unread emails. Not much to say about this supervisor because chances are you still haven't had the supervisions yet. You send email after email and never receive a response. It kind of makes you wonder how a computer scientist survives so long not checking his email. Hopefully you'll get through to them before exams roll around!   Major Trait: Has an unrivaled ice-cold gaze. This supervisor comes in many shapes and sizes. They can be intense in that they expect a lot of you or they can be really into the subject at hand, but these aren't the type of intense supervisor I want to concentrate on. Instead, I want to discuss the supervisor who's just overall intense. You can never feel truly comfortable in their presence and supervisions tend to have awkward staring matches where no one wins. Time will slow to a crawl as you work on the same question for half an hour with no aid. I'm shivering just thinking about it.   Major Trait: It doesn't matter how early you hand in your work, they still won't get around to marking it. This is a tough supervisor to have because you'll find yourself asking the awful question "Can I skip this question without anyone noticing?". And then a few weeks later when you're late night psetting that question will shift to "How much of this problem set can I get away with skipping". By the end of term your work will consist of a few thrown together answers(in beautiful LaTeX) and a slew of question marks. Unlike MIT there won't be be graded psets and midterms to force you to do the work,.Exams are in June and it's up to you to have learned the material by then!   Major Trait: Reliability, you can be sure they've prepared for the supervision. This will be the supervisor you run into most often. They'll mark your problem sets, give you useful feedback and answer any questions you might have, heck, they'll even bring candy once in a while. If these last two terms have taught me anything it's that supervisions, much like recitations, are my saving grace. Where as I'll usually be too afraid to ask questions in lecture of 80+ peers, it's easier ask questions in a supervision of 2-3 (in fact, it's extremely awkward if I don't ). And that concludes my list of the seven supervisors. Sorry for the long delay between posts, I hope to get back to the 1 post a week/fortnight schedule I held this summer. Let me know if there are any topics you want me to cover! The grass is always greener on the other side. Or that's what they say anyways.  When I applied to the Cambridge- MIT Exchange (CME) program, I was pretty excited about the grass.The CME program lets MIT and Cambridge University students swap places for a year (or in my case, a semester because Mechanical Engineering has a special program). The experiences are quite different at both places and listening to the stories from other MIT students who had gone abroad made me really interested in the program. They talked about how they didn't have as much weekly work (we have homework once every two weeks for each class), ate fancy three-course meals called Formal Halls, and of course attended these huge celebrations at the end of exams called May Balls. Plus the college system (similar to Yale), each with their own colors and crest, honestly reminded me of Harry Potter (Cliche, I know...). Although leaving MIT for even a semester seemed really sad, I saw it as an opportunity to experience something new, maybe even something better. Fast forward a couple months to Fall semester after I'd committed to studying abroad...I don't think I've ever had a more brutal fall semester than the one that hit my Junior fall.IHTFP. All day. Every day. Part of the problem was that I was taking this deathly combination of classes to prepare for my semester abroad. The work load from one of my lab classes was incredibly heavy since we had weekly labs/reports and also an individiual project where I needed to make 40+ cups of tea. I was taking one of the most notoriously difficult classes at MIT, 2.006 or Thermal Fluids II (think turbines, compressors, and cycles), which I wasn't sure if I was going to pass pretty much the whole semester... Plus I was spending all my time on the only class I actually derived any joy from: 2.008, AKA yo-yos! Another part of the problem was that I don't think I was making enough time for myself. I wasn't sleeping enough (indeed there were many nights where I slept after my roommates and was up before them in the morning), my activities became more burdensome than fun (as a result of unanticipated circumstances), and I didn't make time to do things that would let me relax like baking, drawing, and taking photos.But I, like many MIT students, lived by Winston Churchill's quote:"If you're going through hell, keep going."  And I made it through. -------------------------------------------------------------My three months here at Cambridge Unversity have been a much needed break from MIT. I was burned out after last semester, and I don't know how I would've made it through another Spring semester (which for some reason is always the more difficult semester for me). Although I'm not as involved as Nati, I'm kind of taking this semester to do the things that I enjoy doing and recuperate.  Since I've been here, I got into running...  baked a ton...   and have been taking more photos!  Cambridge has been a wonderful experience so far, and my time here has helped me put my MIT experience in a new framework. I appreciate that. I'll never take for granted the wonderfully fast, universally-available and fast wifi, the single faucets in our sink (we have separate hot and cold faucets here), and of course the incredible amount of funding for class projects, activities, and research at MIT. That's not to say that Cambridge doesn't also have its wonderful things as well! I enjoy that I have more time to sit and learn the material, instead of drinking through the firehose. We also have these things called supervisions, which are hour-long meetings with a grad student tp talk about the problems you worked on for the past two weeks. Our work is not graded, so there's not too much pressure to just finish the work in time to submit things. Additionally, I'm taking a couple of courses here on materials which talk about different properties that were discovered or researched here at Cambridge University.  The city of Cambridge itself is also incredibly beautiful. But instead of boring you with more words, I figured I'd just take you along on my morning walk to the department so you can get a taste of what it's like to study abroad at Cambridge.  You: Where are you from?Me: London.You: But you...you don't...you don't seem to have a British accent.Me: Correct. Let me explain!

We switched off the generator and the glaring light died. A flurry of moths, freed from the beacon that had attracted them, flew off into the darkness. Three thousand feet below us, fireworks were going off with a faint, delayed crackle. Most nights, this summit was shrouded in mist, but evidently the clouds had taken New Years Eve off. Despite the view, we were alone. The only people crazy enough to camp on the mountaintop were those who would travel to Brazil to study insects.. - - - First, an explanation of who I am and why Im posting on Annas blog. Im an alum of French House. I graduated in 2012 with a double major in Math (combinatorics) and Music (opera singing). I then spent a year in Berlin, Germany, and now am back at MIT to start a Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics. Hi!Most children grow up thinking bugs are cool; I never stopped. It started with butterflies and dragonflies, but eventually I fell in love with moths. Turns out that one in ten species on Earth (including bacteria and plants) is a moth. Many are large and colorful. Some are rare and exciting. Most are beautiful if you stop to look.     Moths of Vermont: Chocolate prominent and maple callus borer moth.      Moths of Vermont: Chocolate prominent and maple callus borer moth. I live in the middle of the woods in Vermont (yes, I wear flannel and do square dancing), and I started photographing the moths at my home. By the end of high school, Id found over five hundred species. Then MIT happened and I happily forgot about insects for four years in a wealth of friends, classes, and math. During my senior year, I realized that I would have a whole summer free after graduation, and I remembered my early childhood dream of finding insects in the rainforest. Surely, that couldnt happen, but there was nothing to lose in trying. Lesson 1. Google is awesome.I searched for moths brazil and this was the first hit. Look, here was an organization that actually needed help identifying and photographing moths in the rainforest! Unfortunately, I also had to get there, and tickets to Brazil are expensive.Lesson 2. If youre passionate and determined about your project, sometimes people will support you.I first tried to get funding through a public service program. I failed, and almost decided to give up. My application had been rejected; that must mean that my idea was silly.As a last hope, I went to see MISTI. This program helps MIT students find foreign internships. I wasnt looking for a standard internship, but I had nothing to lose. Half an hour later I was told I had a plane ticket. MIT-Brazil was a new program without much money, but they would be delighted to support me if I worked hard in the interests of conservation.A CD arrived in the mail from the Reserva Ecologica de Guapiacu (REGUA). On it were over a thousand photographs of unidentified moths. Could I please identify them all? *gulp* Well, this was what Id asked for Dawn over the Atlantic rainforest.  Dawn over the Atlantic rainforest. REGUA is part of the Atlantic rainforest. Most of this ecosystem has been destroyed: its much more endangered than the Amazon. About half the species are found nowhere else in the world, and naturalists are racing to identify and protect whats there before it vanishes forever. Almost nobody is studying the moths. There are just too many of them! Certainly, theres no field guide or anything like that. To identify a species, you have to search through museum collections or hope that theres a photo on the web. Can you tell that these moths are the same?      Two photographs of the moth Epia Muscosa (left photo by Alan Martin).       Two photographs of the moth Epia Muscosa (left photo by Alan Martin). After reading about moths and malaria and What To Do If You Meet A Jaguar, I arrived in another world. The rainforest is a solid block of plants. There are trees and ferns and tree ferns (ferns the size of trees). There are bamboos, palms, vines, and spiny plants that you meet unexpectedly. There are wild oranges, which are green, and wild limes, which are orange. There are bromeliads - living bowls of water where the treefrogs lay their eggs. All of these plants occur right in front of you, piled on top of each other.  Jackfruit, the largest (and tastiest!) fruit in the world.   Jackfruit, the largest (and tastiest!) fruit in the world. Ficus trees are so charismatic that theyve run for Congress.  Ficus trees are so charismatic that theyve run for Congress. There are also animals, but they are harder to see. Colorful birds flash past you and disappear in the leaves, and if you find a fruit tree you may meet some monkeys. You will definitely meet some mosquitoes. There is a constant hum of insects at any time of the day or night, so perpetual that you dont notice it. Every so often, a screaming flock of parrots dashes across the sky and vanishes in the distance.      Butterflies are cute when they sleep.       Butterflies are cute when they sleep. Moths are very considerate animals; they will come to you if you ask nicely. All you have to do is set up a very bright light  too bright to look at. As night falls, moths flutter in from the surrounding forest and flap around the light with determined fascination. They land on the bulb, on the ground, in your hair. Some are tiny, no bigger than flies. Others are the size of bats. Many are experts at camouflage, rolling up their wings to look like twigs, dropping to the grass as leaves, or blending in with the bark of the trees. So many moths! So little time to photograph them! And they are all moving at once in a blur of patterns and colors.You stay up all night, sleep the next day, then do it all over again.

This harlequin beetle was too big to fit on my hand. This harlequin beetle was too big to fit on my hand. After three weeks in Paradise, I returned to Boston laden with gigabytes of photos, which I slowly identified over the course of a year. REGUA has started a moth database to be used by entomologists around the world. Theres a lot more out there, but its a start.With the help of MISTI, I flew back this year during IAP. January is the wet season in Brazil, and it rains a lot. Next to every building is a deep groove in the concrete caused by water falling off the roof. Moths like to go out in the heaviest downpours. I dont. But anything in the interests of science, right?Together with Sue Loose, a dragonfly expert, I spent a week in the mountains, where the most exotic moths are to be found. On New Years Eve, we visited a peak called Caledonia, about 6,500 feet high. Thats taller than any mountain in the eastern US, but at the Equator it could still be warm and vibrant with life.Even in the rainforest, of course, you dont get to spend all your time watching fireworks from a mountain. There are afternoons lugging heavy equipment along a trail. Hours on a patchy wifi network, pleading with Google to tell you what your species is. You learn to deal with unforeseen calamities, the vicissitudes of an environment where you really arent in control.Confusion - when you discover a bat in your bathroom.Frustration - when a gigantic yellow moth appears and is eaten by owls before you can get a photo of it. IT ATE OUR MOTH. (Photo by Sue Loose.)  IT ATE OUR MOTH. (Photo by Sue Loose.) Sue says that the red-eye function simply doesnt work on owls.Despair - when you drop your special moth light and it shatters into tiny pieces.Pain  when you discover you are standing in a swarm of army ants.Panic - when you have set up camp outside a school in a remote valley and manage to set off the burglar alarm in the middle of the night. Will you be able to convince the police that you were just looking for moths?But if Ive learned one lesson, its this: If you truly care about something and persist in working towards it, sometimes it magically happens. Remember your dreams, because they may not be as far off as you think.  i'm from albany, california, which is a tiny square mile and a half next to berkeley, california. as a result, i say hella... hella. my life goal is to be on extreme couponing: all-stars. my other life goal is to avoid being on hoarders: buried alive. i... read more  see complete archives  I'll be honestI had never really planned on going abroad during college. Not even for a bit! (I'm starting to think I'm always more homesick than I realized...) It's a preposterous idea considering how many opportunities MIT churns out every year to send my friends everywhere from DC (okay, that's not really abroad!) to London to Paris to Seoul... I just figured it wouldn't be the worst thing if I stayed a little closer to home. Earlier this semester I committed to taking CMS.634, Designing Interactions. The class, taught by the director of the Media Lab's Mobile Experience Lab, is small, demanding and moves incredibly quickly. Each semester the class works with a different client to learn and apply ideas about interaction design to either improve an existing solution or address an unresolved need. It's a class that ends up sprawling across multiple disciplines, so a unique mixture of architecture, computer science, design and media studies students are thrown together for a semester to work in interdisciplinary teams. This semester the class enrollment was especially limited for two reasons: 1) We would be working on designing an application for Google Glass, and each team of two would be working with their own pair of Glass..es? Google Glass glasses? Goog- whatever 2) After the 6th week, the class would be flown to Istanbul for a week to present to the sponsor companyall expenses paid.  Still, I was hesitant. The trip was scheduled for the week before Spring Break. I had never really anticipated on replacing a block of my calendar with a trip to Istanbul, and didn't feel 100% comfortable about it until I caught up with Anastassia B. '16 just before the trip. Anastassia and I got onto the topic of how we perceive money as something that could buy X amount of Y. I told her I always jokingly see money in units of XBox 360s (a trip to Istanbul? that's like, 9 XBox 360s!) and she humored me. But then she told me that she sees money in how much distance it can buy you. She sees money as a way to unlock the ability to travel across the worldmy head nearly exploded trying to process that idea. It was amazing and foreign and scary and perfectly reasonable at the same time. I committed to the class and last week was one of the most fascinating and grueling experiences of my life. Even though there was no pretense about the amount of work that still had to be done on the trip, I still anticipated 400% more Turkish Delight and 300% fewer hours spent trying to manage my school life (alas, school didn't stop for me while I was away) and my temporary Istanbul work life. While our work is still under wraps until the end of the semester, it's safe to say that we're on track to have a gorgeous Google Glass app. :)           And for the first time in my life, I underpacked. It's another scary feelingI always thought I wouldn't be able to find what I needed at my destination. I wasn't giving myself enough credit! One of my favorite classes this year is CMS.100 -- Introduction to Media Studies, taught by Ian Condry. He's a cultural anthropologist; his latest book, The Soul of Anime, examines the notion of "collaborative creativity" in the context of Japanese anime production and propagation through worldwide fan communities. The idea is, people tend to think of media as having one or a small group of "authors" or "creators"; we associate Spirited Away with Hayao Miyazaki, Harry Potter with J. K. Rowling, Portal with Valve, Beyonce with Beyonce. But it's actually the case that creative production is an intensively collaborative process, whether that means long meetings with production staff to determine the feel and atmosphere of a new film or the wide variety of fan-produced content ranging from fanart to fan fiction to fan-mixed anime music videos (AMVs) to cosplay. From the professional producers all the way down to the fans, there's a creative energy that drives and develops the "universe" of a media phenomenon--as Condry calls it, the "soul" of anime.  This is one of my favorite classes because--let's face it--media is everywhere, through Facebook and TV shows and every web site and textbook and advertisement pasted on the side of a bus. Having a dedicated 5+ hours/week to really grapple with topics like how advertising is changing in the 21st century (two words: big data), how fan culture and fan production works for no good economic reason, why and how viral content goes viral, and so on--it really changes the way you go about your life. I've found myself wondering more about how targeted advertising is placed on my Facebook, or how exactly Twitch Plays Pokemon managed to develop not only a following of millions but also a cultish religion, or how Github has enabled remixing and spoofing of 2048 into expressions of everything from doge derps to college rivalries. And since media is everywhere, this class also means I get to write papers on pretty much whatever I'm interested in--my first paper was a five-page essay about how Valve has empowered amateur fan production in Team Fortress 2.  Another reason this is is one of my favorite classes is that we get to go to events for free. The CMS department sponsored me and a few classmates to go to Anime Boston this weekend to attend my professor's panel talk with the esteemed Dai Sato, anime screenwriter for Cowboy Bebop, Ghost in the Shell, and Samurai Champloo (which is an anime about hip-hop and samurai). Professor Condry, being fluent in Japanese, translated for Sato as Sato talked about how he became a screenwriter and his philosophy of writing.  One thing Sato said about writing stuck with me: "If you want to be a writer, you have to write--but it also helps if you have another skill to draw from and incorporate into your writing." For Sato, that other skill was music and songwriting; he described writing lyrics as a process of matching words to a rhythm, which he uses as inspiration for writing the dialogue in his scripts. Anime and music are also similar in that they're constrained by time--a 3 minute song, a 30-minute anime episode--and there is a challenge to managing that time in the best way possible. Finally, Sato draws from music to create the atmosphere and feel of an anime; for instance, his work for Eureka 7 is heavily influenced by techno music, and Cowboy Bebop has a distinct jazz flavor.  Another thread of discussion focused on Sato's current work with a series called Space Dandy. Space Dandy is heavily influenced by the 1970s and 1980s (though it's set in the future, characters still use boom boxes, cassette tapes, and computers with punch cards). The 70s and 80s were also what some describe as a "golden age" for anime--series like Gundam and Lupin III gained global popularity and gave anime an unprecedented and very unexpected worldwide audience. Sato commented that like fashion, like music, anime seems to have a 20 or 30-year cycle; but since anime only made it big in the 1970s and 80s, the industry is only now going back and drawing inspiration and influence from that original golden-age work. Space Dandy also seeks to challenge the increasing trend of moe anime, so-called "cute little girl anime." As Sato said, with moe it's now often true that you don't really need a story; just the feel and the atmosphere. Space Dandy is attempting to push back a little by exploring deeper topics and taking the artistic style in a more mature direction.  After the panel, our group wandered through the Artists' Alley and the Dealers' Room, where all sorts of artists and craftspeople were selling their wares. Prints of everything from Elsa from Frozen to Sherlock slash pairings, plush My Little Pony beanies, bookmarks, postcards, t-shirts everywhere. It was a veritable visual explosion of colors and fandoms mixing together. Couple in the cosplayers, and you get quite a scene; picture Data from Star Trek: TNG browsing through the Rise of the Guardians prints with Princess Bubblegum from Adventure Time while a whole group dressed as Batman villains gets asked for a photograph by somebody dressed as Loki. That's another thing--everyone is ridiculously nice. The people on the down escalators reach over to their neighbors on the up escalators for high-fives as they pass each other, and every few minutes you can hear somebody saying "you look so pretty!" or "that costume looks badass! nice job!" to somebody else. The sense of fan community is really apparent--it's one thing to read about collaborative creativity in my professor's book, but it's quite another to actually attend a con and see what the fandom is like in-person. We wrapped up the night by heading to Chinatown and sitting down for some good old scallion pancakes and fried rice and Chinese broccoli for dinner, stopping by a bakery for roll cake and egg tarts afterwards. Boston is beautiful at night, doubly so when you're with friends, and triply so when you and your friends are in full cosplay. Sure, you get some odd looks--but you also get compliments. One of my friends was in a blond wig (dressed as Kise from Kuroko no Basuke) and got stopped multiple times by people saying how pretty her hair was. I was thankfully in a less noticeable outfit, as I'd updated my Princess Luna costume from Halloween with the help of a sewing machine I recently began learning to use. The MIT Maker culture is thriving, and it doesn't just refer to making robots and hacking together webapps. Clothes count too! So that kicks off spring break--I'll probably be in lab all week with the Design/Build/Fly team as competition day approaches on the weekend of April 11-13. I can't say much yet--for competition's sake, the airplane's design is a closely guarded secret--but expect blog posts about it soon :) Allan see complete archives         Juliet Capulet, portrayed by Chelsea R. 15 and photographed by Emily K.-L. 16. About a week ago I sat down with one my best friends Chelsea R. 15 to talk about one of her favorite classes, Writing for Social Media, and the universe it comes from. I deeply respect Chelsea for building a career out of her true passions, even though the road hasnt been paved, and I wish Id known older her when I was a younger me. Im excited to be able to share some of her insights with you. I also hope her online work can be a helpful distraction for those of you who are waiting on more college admissions decisions (and/or maybe happen to like Sherlock). Lydia: Okay. Who are you and what are you doing in my house? Chelsea: Um, well, Im Chelsea. Im a junior in course 21E. 21E is something that not a lot of people know exists. 21E (Humanities and Engineering) and 21S (Humanities and Science) are the joint majors; theyre the majors where you squish humanities and science disciplines together. My joint major is between comparative media studies (CMS) and course 6, computer science. I am in your house because you, uh, invited me here. L: Tell me about your Writing for Social Media class. C: Writing for Social Media (CMS.613/21W.751) isIdont know where else you could find a class like it. Its about social media strategy as well as producing stuff for social mediaand stuff is all kinds of stuff. The first portion of the class focused on projecting an image out into the Internet. The focus was looking at how other people personalized their social media images and how brands did it. Then we had to create our own goals and tweet at least five times a day to project some kind of image. I made one focusing more on my goals of eating healthy and keeping fit during a stressful semester. Were all figuring out how to project a consistent image online. The posting has to be regular, which is really important when it comes to social media. The second phase of the class is adaptive Internet stuff. We are doing group projects that adapt some kind ofI think all three of the groups are adapting some kind of extant thing and making it into a Twitter, uh, thing. One group is doing the first season of Battlestar Gallactica. The characters of Battlestar Gallactica are going to be tweeting as if they are going through the first season of Battlestar Gallacticabut with Twitters. Itll sound very, very familiar if youve ever heard of fanfiction. In a way, it is fanfiction, but there are constraints that Twitter offers as a medium for storytelling that make it a very different environment. And then in the third phase we get to do whatever kind of creative project we want butagainTwitter. Right now were all hard at work on our adaptive projects. Those will post throughout March and through the first week of April. L: Tell me about your particular adaptation and the creative work that you are putting into it. C: Its a group project, so its me and its two other students, Gustavo and Taylor. And theyre both wonderful. We decided to adapt Romeo and Juliet for Twitter. Immediately you go, Oh, Romeo and Juliet, everyone knows that story! But there is a reason its still around and were still talking about it, and we continue to study it in school. We are bringing it to Twitter. We tossed around a couple of ideas. Theres one kind of Twitter adaptation that was exemplified by, like, Mad Men roleplayers on Twitter. Mad Men is set in the sixties, and in the sixties you dont have Twitter. That doesnt really matter! Theyre tweeting, from the sixties. We considered doing that with Romeo and Juliet but then we decided to sort of update it instead. Of course there have been updates of Romeo and Juliet. We wanted to do something different, so we changed the conflict around a little bit. And the way were going to tweetthe way were going to treatL: [laughter]C: their Twitters is as if theyre actual people going about their actual lives. They tweet about their days and they tweet about whats happening to them and if some super-dramatic thing is happening in the plot they will not be online to tweet about it. Because thats not how real life necessarily works. (Um, it does work that way for some people.) The fight scene between Tybalt and Mercutio? If Romeos trying to get in the middle of them to stop them from fighting, hes not going to be tweeting about itOMG guys, cut it out!hes going to be conspicuously absent for a period of a couple of hours. If he is being accused of murder he is going to be conspicuously absent for a very long time because he does not want anyone to find him. One of the questions that we sat down and we asked ourselves was, why Twitter? Of course the obviousanswer is because we have to use Twitter for this project. But there should be another reason behind doing any kind of storytelling on any social media platform. Why this platform? What affordances does this platform have and what limitations does it have that make it ideal for telling this story this way? We wanted to get the Internet involved. The thing about Romeo and Juliet is obviously its a very secret relationship: its kept from parents, its kept from the eyes of authority. Where do teenagers keep things from other people? The Internet, right? So thats the direction we decided to go. Of course we also made a few other changes. We aged up Juliet. She is now a high school senior. Applying to college! Well, shes waiting to hear back from colleges. Her parents want her to go abroad to the University of Paris. Shes not sure about it. But she is actually growing up in a college town, fair Verona City, USA. The university in the town is Montague State University. They have a lot of frats and rowdy frat boys. One of the rowdy frat boys is Romeo. If these two people met in real lifefirst of all, they wouldnt. Juliets father is the mayor and he does not want her hanging around these college boys. He doesnt like them very much. They cause a lot of public disturbances. L: As college boys do. C: As college boys do. But online, if they find each other and start talking, there are no limitations...especially if their names arent on their profiles. Well, their last names. And their fraternity affiliations. You understand. Theres nothing to get in the way of that relationship blossoming online, whereas real life factors would have kept them from ever even meeting.L: I think its beautiful that in the same way that Twitter facilitates the relationship of Romeo and Juliet in this adaptation, Twitter and social media facilitate the storytelling and the connection between fans and these stories. C: The thing about telling a story on any form of social media is that it allows the potential for interactivity. The characters in Romeo and Juliet in this adaptation are not just going to be following each other. Theyre going to be citizens of the world. If people talk to them, they might talk back. No promises, but its possible! You know, um, Mercutio, who is, a crazy character, is gonna follow, like, Kim KardashianL: [laughter]C: and Miley Cyrus, you know. L: I follow Miley Cyrus and Kim Kardashian. C: You follow Miley Cyrus and Kim Kardashian. Um. His profile is really funny, by the way. His, um, profile picture is a little bit inappropriate. His display name is Mercuti-YOOOO. L: [laughter] C: So, uh, definitely check that one out. That is probably my favorite of the bunch. And Taylor, whos primarily responsible for writing tweets for him, is very funny. Not only can people talk to the characters, we as writers have to dig into what they do on a day to day basis because people dont only tweet when dramatic things are happening to them. Hopefully that should flesh out the characters and make them more relatable to a wider audience. L: How did you arrive at CMS? How did you find yourself gravitating toward it? C: CMS as a department has an incredible amount of variance in it.A lot of people gravitate towards CMS because theres a lot of things in there about video gameswriting for video games, making video games. What Im interested in is fan cultures, Internet studies, and things like that: writing for the Internet. Its definitely a department that I recommend people check out. People arent necessary aware of their options when it comes to picking a good concentration or even a minor. Theres a lot of opportunity at MIT to open up and explore things you havent explored yet. I think CMS is a great department for that. I wish Id realized it existed when I was a freshman. When I came to MIT I was determined to be course 6, which was so silly in retrospect because I always wanted to write and I kind of wanted to be a novelist. But I was a very practical 18-year-old and I also wanted to make sure I could feed myself. I came to MIT with the intention of majoring in in 6-3, graduating, finding a programming job somewhere. And coding during the day and writing at night and being able to feed myself and never having to really worry about that. L: Still kind of my plan. C: Yeah. L: [laughter] C: The thing that I realized as I took my GIRs my freshman year and I took 6.01 (Introduction to Electrical Engineering and Computer Science I) was I couldnt really envision a future for myself that was structured like that. I looked at the writing department and, you know, the writing department here is stellar, but there was still a part of me that was, like, Oh, dont you want to make sure that you can eat? Of course there are plenty of people who graduate with creative writing degrees who can feed themselves, so I started to look at the other things that MIT had to offer and I came across comparative media studies and the class list and the major structure. I was looking at the classes, and I just said, Wow, this is everything I like to do for fun! but as a major! I can study the things I like to do for fun! Something that I would recommend to everyone is to pursue something that you really love, because it will make your life so much more meaningful. L: Could you tell me about how this connects to someof the work youve been doing outside of your classes? C: Since its a relatively new thing that Im pursuing, Ive only done a couple of internships. I did two internships in LA this summer. One for a PR company, one for a production company, both in their digital departments. I came into that fresh off of taking Fans and Fan Cultures (CMS.621/CMS.821), which is another excellent CMSclass that I really recommend. L: What did you do there? C: I worked a little bit on transmedia stuff for the production company. Transmedia is telling stories across different platforms. I ended up doing tie-in stuff for one of the series they were helping produce. For the PR company I did a lot involving developing digital strategies for the company's clients. They were two very different experiences; they were very different work environments. But I learned a lot there, I made a lot of connections, and it actually led directly to the internship I did last semester and which Im continuing to do this semester. It was different from what my course 6 friends did over the summer. Most of them were at, you knowone of my friends was up in Seattle at Microsoft, and living in a house and getting paid an exorbitant amount of money working at Microsoft and I was sleeping on an air mattress on my cousins floor in her one-bedroom apartment, in Hollywood. Um, andL: Sounds so romantic.C: living off of my savingsso romanticand money Id won in a writing contest at MIT the previous semester. Uh, super romantic. Definitely. I feel like its one of those typical East Coast girl goes to Hollywood, tries to make it experiences except I wasnt trying to become an actress. L: Could you tell me a little about the internship that youre continuing this semester? C: Im working for this company called The Alchemists. They work on transmedia production, transmedia strategy. Theyve done stuff for Coke and they did a series of commercials for Marvel Comics. Theyre currently working on a Hulu exclusive series called East Los High about teenagers in LA. Im mostly helping them with their social media outreach right now. Their companys all about expanding properties onto other platforms and theyre trying to get more of themselves online, too. Im kind of the Tumblr intern. Tumblr is the platform I probably use the most. (Or it was, at least until I had to start using Twitter at least five times a day for Writing for Social Media this semester.) Ive been writing, Ive been helping them update their Tumblr, Ive been writing blog posts for the Tumblr, generally about fans, fan cultures, social media, and how the powers that beas we call theminteract with social media. I did one last week about the show Hannibal, and how Hannibals Tumblr is just so on point. Its exciting. Im learning a lot. And its generally pretty manageable with all of my other responsibilities this semester. L: Could you tell me about storytelling through social media and how itschanged fandom? C: Fans have been telling stories online for a very long time. Id say even some of your casual readers probably know about FanFiction.netthat would sound familiar. Archive of Our Own is the current, uh, quality archive out there. Roleplaying has also always been a big thing. Forums, LiveJournal, uh, and you could call those I guess media facilitated storylines because I think of roleplaying as interactive writing thats kind of more on the spot. I run a blog with a co-author, Sethwho is amazingthat is a work of fanfiction but its interactive because its on Tumblr and the plot is moved forward by question answering. So people submit questions to the characters, the characters will answer, and sometimes theyll just answer in a way thats funny or meaningful, and sometimes theyll say something and it opens up a whole new door into a plotline. And its awesome! When youre chronicling characters daily lives its a lot easier to fill in the gaps. On a TV show thats a crime procedural you mostly only see crime procedural stuff. Youll sometimes get a few minutes of character backstory and looks into what they do every day but not much. Now if the show completely changed course and became, you know, focused on the domestic lives of characters, obviously that would not be what that show would want to do. Through social media its possible to get more of a look into the gaps that the original story doesnt fill in. Fans do this, but like, official powers can also do this. Like, itsits very effective. It makes your characters seem like theyre actual people living in the modern world. I know that for East Los High one of the characters had a vlog and one of the characters who cooked had their recipes posted online. That makes the world seem real: by bringing it onto the Internet, or onto whatever other platform, you're forced to expand the world. And it forces you to expand your characters, too. L: Could you tell me about some of the successful uses of social media by companies that do storytelling? C: Go look at The Alchemists. Theyre awesome. Also, one of the primary examples of this is of course The Lizzie Bennet Diaries. Are you familiar with The Lizzie Bennet Diaries? L: No. C: Okay, so The Lizzie Bennet Diaries is a little bitwe drew a little bit of inspiration from this for our Romeo and Juliet Twitter project. Its an updating and an adaptation of Pride and Prejudice. The main medium through which the story was communicated was YouTube vlogs. Lizzie Bennet had a YouTube channel, and she would do vlogs, and she would invite other people from her life to come on to the vlogs, and, you know, updated versions of the events from Pride and Prejudice started happening. You could just follow the YouTube account and it would totally be fine. You would get a complete story. If you wanted a more complete story, all of the characters had social media accounts. Some of them had Twitters, some of them had Tumblrs, and they interacted with each other. So it wasnt just the vlogs, which I believe came out twice weekly, that told the story. You could watch the vlogs and you would get a complete story. But for a more complete story you could go and read Elizabeth Bennets Twitter. You know? Casual. There are some other properties that have successfully expanded into social media, not from a storytelling perspective but from a fan galvanization perspective. Whether or not youre interested in telling stories online, I think everybody should be getting on that train. Online presences are so important, especially when youre trying to reach the key demographic that most movies and TV shows want to reach (young people). The traditional television format and traditional movies, the way were used to them, is not always the way that its going to be. More and more things are ending up online and things that would have been indie are ending up with wider audiences. As things get progressively disseminated, its going to be increasingly important to draw people in. Again, online storytelling is a really good way to do this. Its something that makes you stand out to fans. I think that more and more storytelling is going to move online. Not necessarily through social media but, you already know, binge watching through Netflix is a thing. Amazon Prime and Netflix and Hulu and all their exclusive online series. I think theyre only the beginning of the trend. L: Tell me about your dreams and plans for the future. C: Theyre a little undecided as of yet. I have an idea, and the idea is that I really want to go into this stuff. Im passionate about storytelling, Im passionate about the digital, and so digital storytelling is really about the best of both worlds. I do want to tell my own stories. I love writing. I would love to write a novel. L: It really feels like youve already written several. C: Doesnt it? It does to me, a little bit. The answer is yes. I feel like they wouldnt be considered novels because a lot of them are either published online or theyre derivative worksfanfictionor theyre both. I undertook an extremely expansive project with Seth to fill in the gaps of the TV show Sherlock. That was the question and answer blog that I mentioned. People would come in and they would ask questions to Watson and Holmes, and I would respond as Watson and Seth would respond as Holmes and we would shoot the response out there into the world. And sometimes if that wasnt enough to explain what was going on with them we would write thousands and thousands and thousands of words to fill in the scenes.   L: The blogs actually gotten very popular, hasnt it? C: Yeah, the blog has a lot of followers. I dont want to brag. L: You can brag. Its okay. C: The blog haswe hit 14,000 a few days ago. Its really exciting. Its sad because Im also having a little bit of trouble finding time to update regularly with my crazy semester schedule but were working on it still. Because the new season of Sherlock came out, that means there is new stuff to exploreL: New gaps to fill in. So many gaps!C: Lets not get into that! But we did give the entire second season of Sherlock this treatment. And I dont even know how many thousands of words we wrote in total. We had probably something like 800 questions and answers, along with a number of prose interludes, and the prose interludes could run thousands of words long. There were 16 what we would call interludes. There were four or five flashbacks, which could be about the same length. There were several transcripts from telephone conversations. All this, um, its basically an insane amount of writing. And it was collaborative between Seth and me, and also between us and the fans. Because the people who read the blog submit questionsyou know, one of them submitted a question from a character we had not even considered incorporating into the story but who became a major player just because someone sent an ask.  L: You dont usually have the power to change the story as youre reading it. Thats really special. C: I think its a way to give back to the people who read. Because they can make a huge difference. I think that a lot of successful people have already sort of figured that out. You know, be good to your fans and theyll be good to you. But this takes it to a whole new level. Its okay to not have 300% control. You can still have a vision. You can still follow that vision. But your vision always has room for alterations. And improvisation. And thats what makes it fun. Thats what were hoping to do with the Romeo and Juliet project. We do have a general outline for how the events are going to go and be adapted. But if someone starts talking to Juliet about physics class, you know, they can talk to Juliet about physics class. Shes in AP Physics. L: Can you help me with my physics homework, Juliet? C: Yeah. You know, and then Juliet can talk to someone about Gausss Law. It could happen! Its not bound. Its a flexible storytelling environment. You guys should all read! You should all read Romeo and Juliet. You know, follow the blog! Read the story. If its not your thing, just drop the story. If it is your thing, you know, ask Juliet about your physics homework. Tell Romeo hes being silly mooningover a girl he hasnt met in real life. Uh. Recommend some music to Mercutio. Send him pictures of big booties. Dontdont publish that. He likes the booty. I mean, but theyretheyre here to be followed but theyre also here to be talked to. And you never know! They might reply. Follow and interact with the characters Twitters here: Alternatively, follow the syndicated list here or a daily digest of tweets on the Tumblr. Have fun! I hope youre all getting excited for Campus Preview Weekend coming up in April (sign up now)! Since I know you just cant wait to meet other new MIT admits I want to let you know about some exciting opportunities for Admitted Students coming up in cities around the globe within the next few days. Weve been working with our fantastic Educational Counselors and other great alumni to put together admitted student gatherings to help welcome you to MIT. Beginning this Saturday, MIT alumni from around the world will host parties in their hometowns for students admitted to the class of 2018. If theres an event in your area, you should check it out  theyre a great opportunity to meet some potential future classmates, as well as MIT students and alumni. I still remember the one I attended in the Bay Area of California in the spring after I was admitted to MIT! Here are a few highlighted events this coming week; see your MyMIT portal for the locations and times of these events, and for a comprehensive list of all of the events. Saturday Sunday Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday But these are just a few so be sure to check the listing on your MyMIT account for the most up to date information and RSVP if requested. There is a whole MIT community that cant wait to meet you. Congratulations and welcome!  You: Where are you from?Me: London.You: But you...you don't...you don't seem to have a British accent.Me: Correct. Let me explain! I was born in Singapore, had a Singaporean accent, then moved to London during the summer before fifth... read more  see complete archives  14 billion years ago (ish), the universe Banged and rapidly expanded. What started as tiny quantum fluctuations also expanded, clumped, and became the structures that we see today. One such large-scale structure is the Virgo galaxy cluster, of which the Milky Way is a member. We, of course, live in the Milky Way, although it's hopeless to try and see that dusty stripe of stars from Boston. Today, as you probably already know, there's Big Science News: we're a huge leap closer to understanding exactly what happened in the first moments of the universe. And word on the street is that this could mean a Nobel Prize for MIT's Prof. Alan Guth. - My first interaction with Alan Guth was fraught with stress and in retrospect a bit impolite. It happened a little over three years ago, when I took my first final exam at MIT. He was proctoring a different exam (relativity) but I didn't know the difference, so when the TAs skipped over my section by accident I marched up to him and said "Hello, my section did not receive any exam booklets." Prof. Guth smiled and asked whether I was in the right exam hall. Bristling at the suggestion that I could have wandered into the wrong exam hall, I said "Um, yes. 8.012 is DEFINITELY in this building, and we DEFINITELY do not have exams." He said oh, okay, and hurried off to find exam booklets for me. Twenty seconds later, I had a fangirl freakout when gears in my brain clicked and I realized who I'd been speaking to. A few months later, I declared a major in physics, and indicated on my advisor selection form that I was very interested in theoretical physics and cosmology (very cute, since in retrospect I realize that I had no idea what any of those words meant). Sometime over the summer, I received an e-mail saying that "Professor Alan Guth has agreed to serve as your advisor. Please use him as a resource for helping you make the most of your time at MIT, and for working towards completion of your Physics degree. Please do stop by and see your advisor on registration day." and I had my second Alan Guth-themed freakout: slammed my computer shut only to immediately re-open it to e-mail my mom, sprinted outside to tell everyone and nearly broke my face on the screen door, and wrote a blog post.  Soon, we were e-mailing back and forth to schedule a class registration meeting (as my advisor, he helps me to come up with an appropriate schedule and signs off on my class registration forms). He signed his e-mails "Alan," and I had a vigorous internal debate about whether that meant it was okay to start my e-mails with "Dear Alan" instead of "Dear Professor Guth." Is it ever appropriate to address A Famous Person by first name?! I e-mailed him to ask. "Yes," he wrote back, "I am happy to have my students and advisees call me Alan." That semester, I took a class taught by Alan: 8.286, The Early Universe. It was a great privilege to learn about inflationary theory from the man who came up with it. Sometimes, one hears about Famous Professors who have zero interest in pedagogy, but Alan isn't like that at all. In office hours one day, he mentioned these crazy things called cosmic strings -- I was so fascinated that I asked him to tell us more about them, and he offered to hold an entire extra session for the class. So, one evening, a group of us sat in a tiny conference room while Alan Guth stood at the board and blew our minds. Fast forward to my junior fall. That was my roughest semester. I spent all my time on Junior Lab and learned that experimental work is My Thing, yet got my butt kicked by 8.05 (Quantum II) which sent me on a downward spiral of insecurity. I remember sitting in Alan's office (surrounded by empty cans of Diet Coke...that guy has a Diet Coke problem) nearly in tears, mortified at the idea of having to discuss that academic disaster with the recent winner of a $3 million physics prize. The first thing he said was "I know you can do better," and then we worked together to come up with a plan for how to move forward. He (along with Dumbledore) helped me put together my Quantum Rehab Program, which consisted of grading for Quantum I and writing lecture notes for Quantum II. On my way out the door, I congratulated him on his $3 million prize and asked if would have our advising meetings in fancy restaurants from now on -- he was amused. Anyway, I'm now taking Quantum III, and feeling comfortable with that material. One of my proudest moments at MIT has been: sitting down in Alan's office at the beginning of my senior spring semester, and telling him about my graduate school acceptances. He wrote me letters of recommendation for nearly all of my grad school and fellowship applications (which is a tale of adventure in itself: Alan is reliable and has always submitted my letters on time, but also reliably submits things JUST in time -- I have had some 11:59 PM freakouts. Oh well. Keeps things interesting, I guess?) and was really excited for me. After my 8.05 troubles, after wondering whether I was really cut out to be a scientist, having graduate schools confirm that they do in fact believe I ought to become a professional astronomer and being able to relay that to Alan meant a lot to me. Today, Alan became famous, again. As you're probably aware if you use the Internet, John Kovac and his team at Harvard just discovered "smoking gun" evidence for inflation: experimental support for the theory that Alan developed decades ago. It's a HUGE deal, albeit a little confusing. You've heard of the Big Bang, yes? Inflation refers to the period immediately following that, in which (according to Alan) the universe expanded at a mind-boggling rate. If this theory is correct, then gravitational waves ("ripples in spacetime") should have been emitted during that period. Scientists have not yet directly detected gravitational waves (that's what the LIGO project at MIT is all about) but so far indirect measurements have been consistent with gravitational wave theory. In the 1980s, for example, a Nobel Prize went to pulsar astronomers (WOOOOO! PULSARS!) for indirectly measuring gravitational wave emission. This time, Kovac & co made another indirect measurement of gravitational waves, but this time gravitational waves from the primordial universe. Essentially, they found exactly what Alan's theory predicted. MIT's physics department has a very high density of Famous Physicists. Yet, I have found very consistently over the past three years that it also has a high density of physicists who are dedicated to undergraduate pedagogy. If I had gone to another school, I might have stuck with my original neuroscience interests and become a doctor -- here at MIT, though, this is the department in which I feel both highly intellectual stimulated and personally comfortable and supported. I really cannot say enough good things about my experiences in Course 8.  So, today, MIT and the astronomy community are abuzz with excitement: I've been getting e-mails from friends, had a few shrieking phone conversations, and there are a lot of universe expansion images on my Facebook newsfeed. Fingers crossed for that Nobel Prize. In any case, I'm glad that I'm such an indecisive student: I end up adding and dropping a couple of classes every semester, so I have accumulated many copies of Alan Guth's signature. Every year we publish a FAQ about the waitlist. Students on the waitlist have lots of questions, so hopefully you find an answer to yours here. How does the waitlist work?We are aiming for a class of about 1050 students this year. Based on our estimates of the percentage of admitted students who will attend (known as the "yield"), we admitted 1419 students. However, it isn't possible to exactly predict how many students will attend this year. To help with the uncertainties, we also keep a waitlist of students. Is the waitlist ranked?No. How many people are on the waitlist?We offered approximately 3% of applicants a spot on the waitlist. Not all of those students will choose to remain on the waitlist. Can you tell me where I am on the waitlist?No, because it's not ranked. We will reconsider all of the waitlisted students again in May, when we know how many students remain on the waitlist, and how many we wish to take from the waitlist. How many people will you admit from the waitlist this year?It is impossible to know. We will have no idea how many people, if any, we will take from the waitlist until the first or second week of May. What has the waitlist looked like, historically?In the last five years, we have admitted as few as 0 students from the waitlist and as many as 78 students. However, it's impossible to know what will happen this year, since we dont yet know what the exact yield will be this year. Can you tell me where my application was lacking, or what I should improve on?If we waitlisted you, it means we really like you, and you do not need to improve on your application. You should, however, continue to get good grades, as we may call your school to check on your academic progress. What are the realities here?True story: it's likely that most people on the waitlist will not be admitted. But remember, any statistic against you (or for you) is associative but not causal. This means, what has happened in the past or on any other application doesn't impact your application. Whom do you admit from the waitlist? For example, if someone from state X or major Y declines, are you likely to look for another student like them?Sometimes we look at things like that but we're not strict about it. So, if a foosball champion decides to go somewhere else, we may, or may not, go out of our way to try to find another foosball player on the waitlist. It just depends on what the list looks like. Are domestic students given priority over international students on the waitlist?No, but we do consider whether admitting international students from the waitlist would put us over our international quota. If I'm waitlisted, can I still come for CPW or do the Overnight Program?No, I'm sorry. I'm still very interested in attending MIT. What should I do if I hope to be admitted from the waitlist?A waitlist confirmation form will be available online in early April. After youve heard back from all the colleges youve applied to, please use the form to let us know whether you wish to remain on the waitlist or not. Once its live, well email you to let you know. The deadline to complete the form is April 25, 2014. Next, be sure to enroll in a college/university by May 1. You do not need to submit additional documents, but if you would like to, you can email mitwl [at] mit [dot] edu and the documents will be added to your application. Excessively emailing us will not help your case (and might hurt it). I would recommend sending us a note (no more than a page in length) to mitwl [at] mit [dot] edu in mid-late April with an update on what you've been up to since our last contact. You can also feel free to provide any other information you think would be helpful. What should I not do?Here are some things you should not do: Fly to campus to make the case in person. Send us ridiculous items or bribes. Submit a whole new application. Bombard our office with way too much stuff. Be pushy. Be sketchy. Let your grades drop. Not choose another college to attend by May 1. What should I do about the May 1 reply date for other colleges?You should accept the offer of admission from another college before May 1, even if it means making a deposit. After May 1, when all students have sent their replies, colleges will determine if they need to go to their waitlist or not, and if so, how many students they need to admit. At this point, colleges will begin admitting students from the waitlist. Students who accept this offer will "unenroll" at the first college and enroll at the second. This shifting can lead to a second round of waitlist admissions. All of this is a standard part of the admissions process. We colleges recognize and accept this. If I'm admitted off of the waitlist, do I have to go to MIT? What about financial aid?You're not required to enroll. We'll give you a financial aid package and you'll have time to consider your decision before letting us know one way or the other. It is in your best interest to complete your financial aid application now (if you haven't already), so that if you are admitted from the waitlist, we'll have a financial aid package ready to go. Our waitlist process, like our entire admissions process, is need blind, and we will meet full demonstrated need for all admitted students. Okay, what should I do now?First, focus on choosing the best fit college of those who have offered you admission. Waitlists are uncertain, so it is always best to ensure your happiness no matter what the outcome. If you are still interested in MIT, you should stay in contact with us. Drop us a note to mitwl [at] mit [dot] edu once things have calmed down a bit. Please always be very nice in all of your interactions with us! Keep us up to date all the way through May 1 and beyond if you remain interested. And in the meantime... be patient. There won't be any waitlist news until early-mid May. Good luck!  see complete archives  MIT Regular Action admissions decisions for the Class of 2018 are now available at You may log in using the same username and password that you use to log in to your MyMIT account. There are no interim screens, so you should be sure you are ready to receive your decision online before logging in to decisions.mit.edu. 18,357 students applied to the MIT Class of 2018. As of today, and inclusive of Early Action, we have offered admission to 1419. These 1419 students are truly exceptional. The admitted Class of 2018 includes mathematicians and marksmen and metallurgists; coders and carpenters and cosplayers; Texans and Tennesseans and Turkmen. Collectively, they represent all 50 states, more than 50 countries, and more than 1000 high schools; together, they constitute an incredible community, each contributing a set of rare skills and perspectives while holding in common the highest caliber of character, conscientiousness, and, of course, remarkable intelligence.  We often say we dont admit numbers to MIT, we admit people. Yet this isnt quite true either: we admit classes, cohorts which have been curated with great care, each student hand-picked to assemble the best possible team to climb the mountain which is MIT. I have to tell you, this is one hell of a team. Every year I tell myself that this class cannot possibly be more breathtaking than the last; every year they take my breath away. There are also those students who may be climbing other mountains, with other friends, next fall. Of the students to whom we do not offer admission today, we have placed a small number on our waitlist and informed the balance that we will not be able to admit them to the Class of 2018. Turning away so many kind, generous, super-smart young people has been more than difficult: it has been truly painful. If you are among them, then all I can say is that MIT is just another place. If it is amazing, it is amazing not because of some local magic emanating from beneath the Great Dome, but because the people here are amazing. And if you are an amazing person, then you can be amazing wherever you go, if you choose to do so. I'm closing comments on this blog post to concentrate conversation in the open threads for admitted, waitlisted, and not admitted students. We've also posted an article over at MIT News.  Congratulations to the Class of 2018. I wish all of our applicants well. No matter where you enroll next fall, please make it a better place. I know you can. I hope you will.        () Use the comment section below to introduce yourselves!   Because of the incredible size and strength of the applicant pool we were unable to offer admission to many, many incredible students whom we would love to have on campus. However, we did place some students on our waitlist. Tomorrow, March 15th, we will post more information about our waitlist - about how our process works, what you need to do if you are still interested in MIT, and so forth. In the meantime, you may talk amongst yourselves below. As always, please keep your comments civil and friendly in our community. This year was one of the most competitive admissions cycles in the history of the Institute. Because of the incredible size and strength of the applicant pool we were unable to offer admission to many, many incredible students whom we would love to have on campus. For those of you who were not admitted, know that we gave your application full consideration, and that we wish you the very best of luck wherever you choose to continue your education. We have left comments open on this thread so you may talk amongst yourselves. As always, please keep the conversation civil and friendly in our community.  Given that tomorrow is pi(e) day, a celebration of irrational numbers and their homonymous dessert counterparts, lets do a little thought experiment. Lets imagine that one day, a pang of hunger strikes you as though the goddess Limos had inflicted a terrible curse upon you. Well, maybe not THAT bad. This craving is just strong enough to make you go off in search of a bakery for a well-deserved snack. As youre wandering through town, you happen across a little corner shop that looks (and smells) promising. You push open the door and smile as you hear the familiar jingle of a little golden bell. And then you see the dessert case; instead of just the typical two-shelved glass box, this case was filled to the brim with pastriescookies, cakes, tarts, creme brulee. Any sort of savory treat that you could ever dream up was in this case, but one item immediately catches your attention. The pie.  This particular pie looks like it belongs in Platos theory of Forms; it exudes the very essence of what it means to be a pie, and all pies are merely shadows of its perfect image. And you know that this will most definitely satisfy your hankering for something sweet. However, for such a quaint little bakery, theres a huge crowd of people bustling abouteach one trying to catch the attention of the frazzled shopkeeper to put in their order. And it turns out, from the snippets of conversation that you catch from the chaotic rumble of crowd noise, that youre not the only one eyeing that perfect pie.  And with the sheer amount of people there, you realize that some people are going to end up getting a slice of that beautiful pie and taste sweet victory (in this thought experiment, victory = the flavor of your choosing), while others will have to watch the pie run out and be stuck in dessert-limbo, not knowing whether to order something else or hope that theres just one more slice tucked behind a souffle. Not everyone who gets their dream slice of pie will treat it the same. Some gulp it down as fast as possible, enjoying the flavor for a second and moving on to other things. Others attack it with gusto and bite off more than they can chew, before they realize they have to slow down to savor the delicious taste. Some get sick of the pie halfway through and need to take a deep breath before finishing their piece, and a few even decide that they dont want the pie and hand it off to someone else in line.  In this moment, all of the hopes overflowing from your heart and mind are geared towards obtaining a slice of this pie. It seems as though you've been dreaming of pie for days, and this dessert is the only thing that could ever satisfy your cravings. But you get so discouraged just by looking at the people around you, all equally hungry, living equally complicated and interesting and wonderful lives.  As much as you desire that pie, as close as you are to tasting it, you must reassure yourself that the world will not end if you dont get a slice. Even though it would feel like a crushing defeat with the waves of hunger washing over your crumpled form (perhaps a minor exaggeration), not getting a slice of the perfect pie doesnt mean that youre any less deserving of it or of any dessert. You just had a lot of competition from equally ravenous people.  If you dont get a slice, you may be at a loss for a moment. As soon as you turned your laser-focus on that pie, you forgot that all other desserts existed. Or you may deny that any dessert could taste even remotely close to the hypothetical flavor of that sweet, sweet pie. But eventually, youll gather your wits, take another good thorough look at the dessert case, and try a different treat. Perhaps youll still have a pang of regret now and then that you couldnt try a morsel of that pie, but maybe youll find that youre more of a cinnamon roll person anyway.  UAG(in which Ceri attempts to make a terrible bio joke) Hows that for a thought experiment? Hungry for some pie? (My victory/curl up into a puddle underneath a blanket/anytime flavor is mixed berry.) Maybe you got something else out of that story too? Eh. Dont think too much about it. Go chill, grab a snack, watch some Pushing Daisies, or a video of your favorite technical college admissions blogger crew being assaulted with food. Zone out and play with a website (or try one of these other ones), read something that inspires you, or thank someone who always cheers you up. (Oh, and best of luck )  I can see the end of my first reading season from here, and it has been a humbling experience. I am full of gratitude to you, our class of 2018 applicants, for sharing your experiences with us. I have shared your FUN jokes and written them on my whiteboard, I have learned facts and lessons from you, I have cried for you. I had a really horrible physics teacher in high school, and your passion for physics has nudged and encouraged me to try again. I have been delighted by your nerdiness and amazed by your accomplishments, whether academic, athletic, or at home. Unfortunately, even with all that you have taught me, I know that I cannot see you all here next fall. I know that some of you will be disappointed and a dream will have been dashed. In one of the moments that I was thinking about this, this quote from Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince came to mind: At the end of his wits, his mind reeling from all of the bad news doled out to him by both Fudge and Scrimgeour, the Prime Minister cries, "but for heaven's sake  you're wizards! You can do magic! Surely you can sort out  well  anything!" (1.131)."The trouble is, the other side can do magic too, Prime Minister," replies Scrimgeour (1.132). Many people view MIT as a magical place and compare it to Hogwarts. They view the accepted as having magic, or more, than those who are not accepted. People around you may think and even say, Dont those admissions staff wizards know anything? Dont they know you belong there? The troubling thing is they may be right. You get this place. You feel academically and culturally connected to the tute. From the long days in committee that Ive now experienced, I can confirm that we wish we had so much more space than we do in the freshman class for you. I am troubled that if you are disappointed on Friday, that you will begin to see yourself as one without magic. I know that is a lie from Lord Voldemort. The main comparison that I am making is this: accepted or not, you all have the ability to perform magic and you will take that ability with you wherever you go. Thank you again for trusting us with so much of who you are, and I wish you all the best always.  For most of high school, the US was just a vague blip on the radar of my imagination. My friends and I sometimes imagined what the experience of studying in the US would be like, but we spoke in the offhanded, dreamy tone people usually use to describe things like winning the lottery or running for president. I had read one of the MIT blogs once, stumbling onto Annas post, Being Qualified for MIT, but only with distant fascination, fascination because it was such good writing and MIT seemed like such an amazing place, distant because I didnt seriously think that I could attend a university whose site I had stumbled onto from a friends Google search of Worlds Best Universities. And then one morning, towards the end of the first trimester of high school senior year, I was sitting in the library, studying for a Geography exam when someone ran up to me and said I had a package awaiting me in the secretarys office. I rarely received packages of any sort, so I was pretty curious. Not being a cat, I ran quickly to the office and seconds later, was tearing off DHL-branded tape from what appeared to be a thick file. The file was from the University of Pennsylvania, and inside I found several brochures, and a letter. The contents of the letter went along the lines of, You seem like a pretty motivated student; you just might be the kind of student were looking for! We encourage you to seriously consider applying to Penn. It was the first time I had heard of Penn, and my mind hadnt yet been cultured to the term Ivy League or anything of that sort. I knew nothing about the US admissions process, and hadnt been searching, but the idea that a college thousands of miles away would send me mail of this heartwarming sort was unbelievable. I called my parents and more or less ranted about it. I was given rare access to the internet to find out more about Penn. I checked out the universitys website and Wikipedia page. I found CollegeConfidential links to angst-filled posts covering the spectrum of Penn from its prestige to its exclusivity. I did try to think of why they had contacted me. I had taken the SAT nearly a year ago, but that had been routine process for my high school (which was partly owned by the Turkish Government), and only because a bunch of Turkish universities required the SAT. There had also been the AMC and AIME, which I think may have contained some random clause about sharing scores with universities and scholarship organizations. Regardless of the reason, I was glad some university out there seemed interested in me. Deadline was already fast approaching, so I hastily worked on my Common Application, and sent it to Penn within days of their mail. I also sent in my SAT scores and registered for the SAT Subject Tests. I could barely wait the three months to find out the status of my application. In that time, I joined CollegeConfidential, and began to read more about Penn. I found old admit and reject threads and, for the first time since receiving the package, was daunted. My SAT score from 11th grade had been 2080. It was possibly the reason Penn had contacted me, and I was pretty fine with it. But then there were all these amazing scores...2350...2390...even perfect scores...getting rejected or waitlisted. And CollegeConfidential was full of pages upon pages of these drab stories, rejected applicants whose achievements transcended some exam to cover a host of truly amazing feats. It was my first real introduction to the holistic mechanism of the US admissions process, and it created a whirlpool of uncertainty. Did Penn make a mistake? Did Penn really send me that package? It was all I could do to balance my sanity between the fear precipitated by the high scores on the reject threads, and the glimmer of hope induced by the relatively lower scores on some parts of the admit threads. I went back to my application, and with some clarity of mind I must have gained in the past couple of weeks, cringed at some of my essays. To one of them asking why I wanted to be at Penn, I had started thus: I am one of several applicants aspiring to become a member of the prestigious UniPenn (!). To begin, I feel like the resources the university has to offer are unparalleled relative to anything Ive seen before... Was this enough? Would this be enough? It was a little while before Penns decision date when the results for the AMC12  contest were released, and I saw that I had placed at the 99th percentile worldwide, and had qualified to the AIME. I was pretty excited, and after a while, in a realm of elation separate from mere joy at this achievement, I realized that the news could also boost my chances. Excitedly, I sent an e-mail to one of the admissions officers that had contacted me some weeks back, informing him of the news. He replied a few days later, saying that it would be considered with the rest of my application. Awesome! March 29th, 2012 was a Thursday. Penns decision was hours away. The anxiety, the pure, crazy anxiety permeating the pages of CollegeConfidential was this charged cloud you could feel poking your sides. I was tense; I was crazy. I played the will they-wont they game in my mind. I posted like crazy on CC, asking one of the common What are my chances post. Some said I had a decent shot but it was hard to tell. Others said everyone had a low shot. A few were highly cynical of the post itself. All these really just combined to feed the worry. My friends were around me, and they had nothing but positive comments: Youll get in; its you! and Theyll be crazy to reject you! I didnt know what to think, but the closer the decisions came, the more encouraging my friends got, and from their words, a real glimmer of hope emerged. You do have a chance, I told myself. Penn encouraged you to apply!  A while later, I was somehow standing beside my vice-principal while he logged onto Penns website. Drums banged in my chest and throat. Three close friends crowded behind me. I typed in my initials, my hands so shaky it took two tries to get the password right. And text suddenly appeared, text that read: Dear Vincent,After careful review of your application, we are unfortunately unable to offer you admission into Penns class of 2016... My heart calmed. My body went very still. A friend behind me groaned and flung his books. I rose and said in a falsely nonchalant voice, Well, I tried. My friends mumbled words I didnt really hear. I walked out of the office and sadness overwhelmed me.***The week following Penns rejection was long and slow. I was moody. Classes seemed to trudge. I realized that for the past four months, regardless of my fears regarding the Penn outcome, I had absentmindedly imagined myself as a student there, a Penn Quaker, soaking sun in the quad and screaming cheers in the Franklin Field. It didnt seem fair. It didnt seem right. In the weeks that progressed however, what was left of school took over my mind. Writing stories took over my mind. Olympiad classes took over my mind. Penn faded.***I finally convinced myself that Id been indulging in wishful thinking by imagining that I could study in the US. I decided to face my local exams and gain admission into an awesome Nigerian university. Admission into a Nigerian university is different and purely quantitative, depending on a combination of three necessary componentsan exam called WAEC, taken by most West African High school students, a localized examination called JAMB and the concerned universitys own examination (usually called post-JAMB). Due to great restriction on the number of Nigerian universities I could send my JAMB scores to, and a number of post-JAMB conflicts, I only really had one Nigerian university I could apply to, which of course depended on me passing its post-JAMB. So imagine my shock when, at a hotel in Amsterdam for the International Math Olympiad 2012, I decided to check the post-JAMB schedule and saw something quite interesting: the exam was set to take place in about five days. It was the beginning of IMO, and there was clearly no way Id make it back to Nigeria in time. I spoke to my mom in distress about this, but in the sweet, soothing tone that parents often use, she assured me that Id be fine.***Just shortly before graduation, my high school had held an annual Nigerian-Turkish cultural event. Activities bloomed throughout the day, with tasty food on standby for the hungry or tired. My mom came for the event, which was nice since I attended a pretty secluded boarding high school, and rarely got the chance to see her. Towards the end of the day, she made a friend called Mrs. Jimoke. As they chatted about the school, my mom told Mrs. Jimoke about most of the academic things Id been up to, including taking the SAT. Mrs. Jimoke insisted that I reconsider applying to US universities, and gave my mom the contact information of one of her friendsShade Adebayowho worked in an educational sector of the United States Embassy. So after I missed my post-JAMB and after it became clear that I would have to wait at least a few months before I could apply anywhere else, Shade insisted that I apply to US universities. At first I was reluctant, but I realized that a world of possibilities did exist out there, and even if Penn hadnt accepted me, I could probably find some other institution that would. Shade, energetically, vehemently, believed so. I consciously avoided considering extremely selective colleges, and did as much research as I could on the others. Since I was so far away, campus tours and admission information sessions were out of the question. I toured CC, read up several college-related books Shade let me borrow from the US Embassy. I went through websites and Wikipedia pages and more detailed places like Unigo. And I came upon UW-Madison. It had a strong engineering program and a campus that seemed to pulse with unique life. As I became more and more entrenched in UW-Madison, reading up its online newspapers, poring over CC threads, I realized an important difference in the way I was attached to UW-Madison and the way I had been attached to Penn. My obsession with Penn had stemmed from both the strange joy of being reached out to and the beauty of the idea that I could be an undergraduate there. I was overwhelmed by the sense of prestige it possessed and some awareness that it had amazing resources I felt I could only find in few other places. I merely had a general sense of what Penn could be for me, a generality that translated into my barely specific essays. But getting to consciously choose to apply to UW-Madison, I did so on the heels of a more developed sense of what the university and its culture were about. I applied for the Spring 2013 term and was accepted. I was speechless with joy when I saw the letter of acceptance. My parents were jubilant. But of course, there was a problem.***UW-Madison did not offer aid to international students, and my parents would have to pay just a little over forty thousand dollars per year. They assured me that it wouldnt be a problem, but my mom did wonder if I wanted to apply anywhere else. I was somewhat vehement about my choice of UW-Madison, having grown deeply attached to it, and she assured me that as long as I was sure, it was fine. I spoke to Shade afterward. She told me something my mom had confided in her. My parents were willing to pay forty thousand dollars, but it was really money they didnt have. They had begun contemplating possible assets they could sell to fork up some of the money, and the only reason they hadnt divulged this to me had been a result of my endless excitement with the acceptance news. Shade told me that it would be worth it, absolutely worth it, if I could let UW-Madison go in favor of some university, any other university, that wouldnt cost as much. Later that night, I sat alone in my room and thought of my parents willingness to sacrifice that much for my happiness. I thought of how my educational future, once bright and limitless, now seemed and felt infinitely more constrained. I was overwhelmed by weariness and a strange sense of loss. And so I sat on my bed and cried. I cried for a while, and my mom slipped into my room while I lay hunched over, just feeling deflated. She held me really close. She told me things would be alright. She told me that I would end up where I wanted and needed to be, and that she would walk to the ends of the Earth to secure my happiness. I believed her, every word. I held her closer. The next day, I declined UW-Madisons offer of acceptance.***And thats the bulk of it. Thats why I took a gap year. I applied for the fall term to US universities. I meticulously compiled a small list, considering two important personal factorscost and culture. Culture in the sense of its people, culture in the sense of energy, culture in the sense of challenge. I had spent most of high school taking extracurricular olympiad classes that pushed me to work late hours at night. I had felt most ingrained in the learning process when I raced with those challenges constantly, and especially with my classmates. I wanted an environment like that. I wanted an atmosphere built on merit and challenge and collaboration, one that could let me push myself, because I understood I could thrive there.  I also needed a place I could afford. I took the SAT for a second time, attaining a score of 2390. I wrote more, feverishly, stories and novellas and ultimately a novel. I spent that year primarily outside of classes, although I did do a few things   like teaching and attempting to burn down the kitchen cook. I grew closer to my family. I grew closer to myself. More clearly than ever, I began understanding what I wanted. Princeton accepted me Early Action. Harvard rejected me. MIT accepted me on Pi Day, and I will never forget ten words that kept sinking into my mind when I saw that letter of acceptance: We think that you and MIT are a great match. I will never forget the sheer look of joy on my parents face when they saw the letter of acceptance and the immensely generous financial aid offer that had come with it. I will never forget them enclosing me, the world vanishing, for that moment of intimacy to take over, a moment that told me in no uncertain terms that things were fine. Things were good.***Im not really going to talk about CPW or about making the choice of college in this blog post, because thats not really what its about. Ill tell you what I hope this post is about. Its about the frightening rollercoaster that the college application is. This process is merely more than just typing up words and hitting a submit button. Youre sending away, with each application, a little investment of emotions, and a little bit of life that washes into some machinery and potentially shapes the next four years. Yes, the applications are important, and yes, its alright to be invested. If this is about where you will spend a good chunk of your life, I daresay its necessary to be invested. But at the same time, youll need to distance yourself from the process a bit. Care about it but not to the extent that it intricately wraps itself around your self-worth.  For colleges as deeply selective as MIT, theres a lot out of your control, and regardless of what that letter you see on Pi Day says, it really wont matter in the long run. If its a yes, congratulations. Youve been given a great opportunity. MIT deeply believes in you. If its a no, thats fine. Its not a declaration of your worth; its not MIT saying that you dont belong; its not a testament to some kind of skewed outlook your future will take. A long time ago, I did all the wrong things. I worried about the little details and applied without a true sense of what I was applying for. I tried to put greater meaning into scores and stats than they really held. I was obsessed with getting in to the point that it somehow became the center of my daily thoughts. And when rejection did come, I was stunned and upset. I felt denied of some deserved right, when it was really more privilege than right. Genuinely care about the places you apply to, and if you do find that a certain college has no room for you at this point in time, then Ill tell you what my mom told me: you will be fine. Penns rejection tore me down, but if Id known then what I know now, not about where I would end up, but about how I can rise above a letter of rejection, Id have handled it a whole lot better. And I do want you to know. With tenacity of will, the future will shape itself to suit you and your inner strength. Life delights in throwing stumbling blocks. But where wounds may be inflicted, scars heal and strength grows.***Another thing I hope this post is about: time, people. The people that have been there with you from the get-go, the friends that you made in high school, the parents that have held you close and whispered assurances; theyve forged themselves into your life before now, and they will for a long, long time. Every step of the way that led to MIT, for every rejection and acceptance and moment of uncertainty, I had friends and family who wiped away my tears when tears came and held me high when joy arrived. Time with the people we love is a truly beautiful gift. Consider the extent of the things they have done and could do, will do, for you, and learn to appreciate them every day. Life is much bigger than what will happen soon, more unpredictable than whatever signs that hang in your mind try to suggest. For now, try not to fret. Keep doing the things you love. Keep writing. Keep playing trombones. Keep making slam-dunks. Keep singing. Keep watching your favorite TV shows. Keep laughing. And keep the people you love close to you. I took a gap year out of necessity. At the time, it felt like the worst thing that could happen. It felt too long and the question of where I would end up seemed very subject to chance. But I kept living. I kept pushing forward. And somehow, Im here right now, typing from a place that had once felt too large to be a dream. Whatever happens in the next couple of days, you will find that you do have the strength to keep living, that you will be where you need to be, and that you will thrive. Dont overanalyze the steps leading to that point. Some things you just cant predict. And even though it may not always feel like it, trust me. Youll be fine.*** Christina T., Me, Erica D., and Jen L. representing MIT in Florence! So I don't know if you could tell, but I was teaching in Italy over IAP. In October, I applied to MIT's Global Teaching Labs Program, and after an application and interview, was deemed among 30 or so students qualified to teach Italian high schoolers some science, in English. I'd like to present my experience as 10 lessons-- not the ones I taught, but the ones I learned. (  )*:           1. Don't worry about the uncontrollable. Here, I specifically mean flying. Due to the polar vortex commotion, my flight to Milan was one of the thousands cancelled and rescheduled for a full 2 days later. Arriving late to my job wasn't a problem because I made up the missing hours by teaching a few extra classes. On the way back, my flight was delayed again-- but don't blame the polar vortex, this time it was all me. In the JFK layover, I somehow fell asleep while sitting at the gate... for exactly the 40 minutes it took for my plane to arrive, board, depart, and probably get to Boston. Classic.           2. Do things you think you can't. When I signed up, I agreed to teach Biology and Chemistry. I love those subjects. I know them pretty well. But when I got assigned to my school, they wanted me to teach --gasp-- math and physics. Physics. We're talking the subject I never took in high school, and merely passed freshman fall. I cant... right? Ok, time to properly learn it! In the end, I loved and felt awesome teaching all my subjects, which turned out to be a whooping mix of: Electricity, Combinatorics and Probability, Acid-Base Chemistry, and Biology.            3. However little time there is, use it. For example, in learning a new language before traveling to that country. You know, it's mathematically proven that learning at 200 word vocabulary is 100 times better than just knowing "pizza" and "espresso." And from my experience, having 30 minutes to plan a lesson is infinitely better than none. And having a few hours is infinitely-infinitely better than that. But now we're getting into different types of infinities, which is it's own blog post.            4. Embrace culture. Basically, I never drank a single cup of American coffee while in Italy... and probably won't ever again. While embracing other cultures, don't forget to break stereotypes from our own! Because the majority of America is not uneducated, wasteful, and overweight. I think. I hope. My host family was continually surprised that I knew food such as linguine, fettuccine, and gnocchi. Though the dishes my host mom and grandma made were of course the best I ever had, being homemade and mouth-melting.            5. Don't be afraid to say "yes." I kept taking on more classes and experiences, and didn't regret a single moment. With my host family's older brother, I went to my first Qwan Ki Do lesson. Having never done any form of martial arts before, I was a tad intimidated to go. But alas, I am now wiser about how to handle a bamboo stick.           6. Don't be afraid to say "no." Teaching in Italy turned out to be way more intense than I ever anticipated. Having to prepare and deliver lessons 6 days a week was an immersive experience, but it was also taxing. Make sure you're not pushing your physical limits. I felt so energized and excited when I was around people, but a bit overwhelmed when planning for the next day at night, every night. I needed to recuperate for a few solid days when I came back to campus. But it was so worth it.           7. Some things are universal. Or quasi-universal. Like Latin. Really, I hadn't expected SAT skills to come up again in my life, but studying all those Latin roots definitely eased me into Italian. Also universal are facial expressions and hand gestures, which definitely overcompensated my language deficit. I can leave it unsaid that attitude and kindness can be sensed without words.           8. Open yourself to people. I stayed with the most wonderful host family while in Italy. It was truly incredible getting to know them, and their extended family, and all their family friends. Everyone I personally had met in Italy was so warm, so thoughtful, and so willing to feed me good Italian food. The language barrier won't be so bad if you radiate feelings (also I was really lucky that someone would always be able to speak English). Giant shout-out to Flavia, Nereo, Elia, Filippo, and Nonna for welcoming me into their lives!            9. Get out there! Because Italy is about 2 Floridas (a standard unit of measurement), and I come from a strong public transportation background, I loved using Italy's transportation system to get me to places I have never been to before. Example: Mountains. Wow.            10. Make an impact, however you can. GTL emphasizes Mens et Manus, MIT's motto. In this way, it was good that I couldn't entirely rely on English to get information across-- I used many visual, experiment-based, and exploratory methods.  I believe that *discovery* is an essential component of learning, while passion is an essential component of teaching.   All in all, I learned to teach and taught to learn! * *(^ o ^)/* *  Growing up, I admit that I watched a decent amount of television. I wasnt a couch potato by any means; I loved to go fishing with my neighbor, take walks in the shaded walkways behind my house, or build oddly shaped sculptures in the sandbox with my friends. The magic of television lay in its ability to transport me to another world, another story, and another life. So I indulged in the visual fantasies, especially when I came down with a case of the sniffles and the best place to curl up and nap was the sofa in front of the TV. A side effect of television was the exposure to the infamous world of infomercials. Early morning and late night viewings were fraught with empty promises and enticing offers for magical stain cleaning liquid, blankets (with sleeves!), and convenient kitchenware that would help you slap your troubles away. But after a while, even the low, low price of $19.95 wasnt enough to convince me that those products were worth buying. Id finally developed a healthy dose of marketing skepticism. While contemplating my collegiate future, I read my fair share of pamphlets, hand-outs, and websites, all expounding on their respective colleges advantages and benefits. I half expected the next pamphlet to offer me free shipping and handling if I called right away. Maybe I had a little bit more than a healthy dose of skepticism, but the point still remained that without experiencing the college firsthand, there was no way for me to know what they really meant by rigorous curriculum or unparalleled opportunities. As decision time approaches, many of you are probably facing the same dilemma. On MITs admissions website, we claim that MIT is one of the best places in the world to be a student and the top two reasons listed are the incredible faculty and the strong culture of student collaboration. Bold words. Id just like to put my two cents out there and let any prospective students know that sometimes, even catchy promotional phrases can ring true. Incredible Faculty: As you all probably know, MIT is known for having some famous faculty. Professor Eric Lander, perhaps best known for his contribution to the Human Genome Project, teaches 7.012 Introductory Biology (which I took last semester) along with Professor Robert Weinberg who discovered the first human oncogene Ras. Of course, many universities have their own famous and accomplished faculty members. But from personal experience, I can attest to the fact that the faculty members here really seem to care about the students and they are willing to do more than just stand in front of the lecture hall and teach. Last semester, a group of six students and I took Professor Weinberg out to dinner via the UA Student-Faculty Dinner program. He didnt treat the invitation as an obligation, but rather seemed genuinely happy to spend a night talking to his students. We spent hours at the restaurant, talking and laughing about research, MIT, and life in general. One digression led to a conversation on the nature of lactose intolerance and the extent to which each of us enjoyed dairy products (I, for one, am a great proponent of cheese consumption). This semester, ClubChem hosted a faculty dinner with Professor Danheiser, the professor for my 5.12 Organic Chemistry course. While devouring plates of deliciously free Thai food, we all sat in a circle of desks as the professor recounted his own life story and answered any student questions. His experiences as an undergraduate researcher were hilariously relatable and he wasnt afraid to laugh along with us. The professors here are people too and they want to get to know the students they are teaching. Needless to say, in the classroom, they do their job well. My 18.03 Differential Equations professor always shows up to class with a huge smile on his face and a bounce to his step, eager to begin the lesson. Unfortunately, I make the mistake, sometimes, of leaving my 18.02 Multivariable Calculus pset until the night before its due. WE INTERRUPT THIS BLOG POST WITH AN IMPORTANT PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT: ** Do not, I repeat, do not leave your psets until the night before they are due. Bad things will happen. Horses will start eating each other and Voldemort might return. Also you might not get any sleep, which is probably even worse than those other things. Ok. Thank you. That is all. ** On this particular Wednesday evening, I was sitting by myself, slogging through mathematical proofs by the dim glow of my desk lamp. A glance towards my warm bed only solidified the regret I had of starting so late. I was all by my lonesome self now. The problems on our psets are designed to test problem solving skills, not just a students ability to regurgitate the formulas and equations. Working with others allows us to bounce ideas around and compare methods. In the real world, you arent alone; there are usually people around you who can help. The homework at MIT taps into this mindset and the professors encourage us to work together as we will when we leave the shelter of a college campus and enter into another phase of our lives. Of course, there are people who breeze through the psets on their own with no problem. But for the most part, as you stroll through the student center, or the basement of Maseeh, you will see clusters of students at every other table and chair, working together to finish a pset or a project. Student collaboration isnt just a suggestion, its the norm and its something I appreciate about MITs culture. But wait, theres more!: To be completely honest (and thats all Im trying to be here, for the benefit of my fellow skeptics out there), I cant say whether or not MIT is unique in its incredible faculty or culture of student collaboration. Never having experienced other colleges firsthand, theres no way for me to know whether or not they too live up to their brochure and pamphlet standards. But no one is making me write this. I just wanted to share my own perspective. Thats the best we can really do: provide our own snapshot of MIT. Its like a collage. No one photo can truly encompass everything that MIT is and represents, but each opinion adds something to the conversation. So if you have any questions, Id love to answer them! And if you email right now, Ill throw in a free doodle! Yes, thats right, Ill answer your question, and send you a free doodle of whatever you want!* *Terms and conditions may apply.  ...don't freak out.  1. Prepare Your WifiI applied early to MIT last year, so decisions came out at something like 9:30 AM on a Saturday morning (Pacific time). During that time, I was scheduled to be at a day-long retreat with my church youth group with no Internet access. I also didn't have a smartphone. I sure wasn't going to spend all day in agonized waiting for wifi access (especially on a retreat day where I was supposed to be focusing on my relationship with God), so my I gave my brother my MyMIT password and asked him to check for me. I got to experience the torturous thrill of waiting for the admissions results page to load by proxy, via my cell phone buzzing in my pocket and loading the text message my brother sent me. (It was something short, along the lines of "Congratulations!").If you're always nervously unpatient about these sorts of things, like me, it might be a good idea to plan this one ahead. But to each their own. You might want to wait until nighttime and open your letter under your covers so you're not in public when you find out. You might want to open it together with your family or close friends there for support. Speaking of which...2. Prepare Your FriendsI had a close friend who also applied early to MIT. We of course wanted to know if the other had gotten accepted, but our primary mode of communication was (and still is) gchat. This presented a bit of a problem when I had no wifi access and wouldn't be able to talk out loud, and his phone didn't have a texting plan. We decided to set up a calling system where if either of us got accepted, we would call the other person and let the line ring. No phone call == no acceptance.After I got my brother's text message and had a momentary mental celebration, I dialed my friend's phone number and crossed my fingers for his reply. It came two minutes later. We're roommates now.It's a good idea to set up something like this if you have close friends who also applied to MIT. At the same time, if you don't arrange something like this, be careful of being that guy or gal who goes around asking everybody who applied if they got in. That's a very tricky and sensitive position to maneuver and odds are you're not a very popular person for it.3. Stay Off CollegeConfidential  I don't know a single person who has gone to CollegeConfidential and felt better about themselves, their situation, or their application. I'm talking about you, /massachusetts-institute-technology. In my experience CollegeConfidential is more a source of stress and nervousness and personal insecurity than anything else, and it's not going to help you in the days leading up to Pi Day. Frantically checking CollegeConfidential is sort of like scratching an itch or twiddling your thumbs until they're sore. You're waiting for results and you want to do something about it, so you check websites like CollegeConfidential compulsively. Don't. (Please). Reading about all the accomplishments of other people who have applied or already been accepted will not be a Fun Time (unless you too are a seven-time International Math Olympiad gold medalist and have also developed cures for both HIV and breast cancer, in which case you dont need CollegeConfidential anyway). You are, of course, welcome to check MITAdmissions compulsively instead of CollegeConfidential. I recommend rewatching the bloggers Pi(e) Day video. Its a documented source of happy.4. Keep Yourself Busy In other words, keep twiddling your thumbs. Get a project done or marathon the entirety of Buffy the Vampire Slayer this week (highly recommended). Make pies. Eat pies! If you keep yourself busy you won't have to think about the impending decision day looming on the horizon. In fact, it might even be a good idea to work ahead on schoolwork--whether you got accepted, waitlisted, or rejected, you're not going to want to get much work done after pi day. 5. Say Your Thank Yous Now's a good time to send thank-you emails to teachers that recommended you and everyone who helped you with your application. People like being updated, and then on pi day all you have to do is follow up that email or note with your results. It's also a great way to calm your nerves, taking a moment to remember those who've helped you. Heck, write your dog a thank-you note. I'm sure he or she gave you loads of furry comfort during application season. 6. Relax Seriously. This is The Most Important Thing. Take this week and promise yourself that you'll get enough sleep, eat breakfast every day, watch an episode of My Little Pony every day, whatever. Have some fun! You already deserve it for making it so far in high school and choosing to applying to MIT.  Much love! After pi day there will be discussion threads here at MITAdmissions for everyone, no matter your results, so come hang out with us :) --Allan I spent the first 18 years of my life frolicking in San Jose, CA, untouched by the rigors of real work and uninflated grades. Now, I... read more  see complete archives  Even though MIT decisions are released on the same day every single year, it's been announced with more and more fanfare every year. This year, Chris Peterson summoned me back from my alumna grave to apply my treasury of comedic novelty photoshoot experience to pieing the bloggers in the face. The initial (terrible) script I spat out was heavily influenced by action-spy-thriller-heist-explosion movies. Tim the Beaver flips on the harsh overhead lights of an interrogation room, illuminating a lone blogger; perhaps a meat hook swings out of focus as we pan across the tense scene. In slow motion, Tim waddles over to a table full of pies and heaves one at the blogger. In even more gratuitiously slow bullet-time, the pie makes impact, rippling the victim's face cartilage in a scene reminiscent of most episodes of Mythbusters. We flip the camera around to show Tim's MIT shirt as everyone runs into a pie-covered group hug. At some point, Chris, his wide eyes filled with nefarious joy, licks pie off of Emad's horrified face, still in slow motion. On Sunday, we couldn't get Tim on short notice, we realized our slow motion cameras were grainy, the sun kept moving behind clouds, and we had no idea what we wanted our final video to look like. We threw some dropcloths down on the steps of Lobby 10, I set up my normal non-slow-motion camera as "backup", and we just went for it.   Then everyone started giggling, and smiling, and eating pieces of pie from their own faces. And it transformed into something completely different from Pie Hard With A Vengeance; something infinitely better and more adorable than we had originally imagined.    Chris Peterson bravely volunteered to take on all of the remaining pies. For those of you with the stomach to watch, I offer you this video.  We had a lot of cleanup to do...  The geese on Killian helped!  For the next few hours, Chris and I edited this thing together over burritos and many arguments of "is that pie hit two hundredths of a second too soon before the flute?", listening to Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake Waltz at least a hundred times over in the process.  The mission of the admissions blogs is to humanize MIT. I hope that this video, in turn, humanizes the bloggers -- helping you put a face to all these excellent people whose lives you get a glimpse into. A round of applause for the champs who took cold pies to the face while it was just above freezing outside, laughed through it all...and ate more pie.  Thanks Michael '16 for taking most of the behind-the-scenes photos! There are more posted in the MIT Admissions Facebook group. May you have a happy Pi Day soon! Much love,rfong  You: Where are you from?Me: London.You: But you...you don't...you don't seem to have a British accent.Me: Correct. Let me explain!

In this case, I realized that the dates were during my spring break, said "heck yeah," and applied. On Valentine's Day, I got a message saying that I'd been accepted, and within a week received a whole bunch of homework. My group consists of myself, a PhD student from Georgia, and a solar astrophysicist at Harvard. The AAS has a whole website on how to contact and schedule meetings with representatives, so I read through that in order to get myself from Zero Knowledge to Some Knowledge. My fellow Massachusetts resident and I divided up the labor so that I'm in charge of scheduling meetings with Senator Ed Markey and Representative Michael Capuano, and she's in charge of getting hold of Senator Elizabeth Warren and Representative Katherine Clark.  Now, I'm normally very happy to pick up the phone and call whoever, but something about calling a Senator's office and requesting a personal meeting with him (or one of his science/tech staffers) freaked me out. This afternoon, I drank a cappuccino and in a fit of (possibly caffeine-boosted) confidence resolved to finally make the call. It rang twice, and then, This past Monday, I found out that I passed my national EMT exam.  I was so happy - now I am officially a nationally certified firefighter and EMT!  Little did I know, my new skills as an EMT were going to be quickly tested. It started about 1am that night.  I had been getting in and out of bed and walking around, trying to force myself to fall asleep.  I have been having a lot of problems with sleeping lately, where it takes hours for me to fall asleep and it is really hard to stay asleep.  At 1am, there was a knock at my door.  I am a Medlink in East Campus, and I believe very strongly that if people are sick on hall, they should feel comfortable coming and knocking on my door.  Many of us Medlinks in East Campus feel this way. That was what the knocking was about.  I asked who it was, and the girl at my door told me that she did not feel right.  I opened the door and let her in.  She sat on my floor, and I sat with her.  She said that she was having trouble sleeping, and felt really awful. A stabbing feeling in her stomach. I palpated her abdomen, like a fancy EMT, and it was fine other than the pain.  But it was the worst pain she had felt, unlike any other.  I helped her to her room.  I got a bowl from the kitchen and put a bag inside in case she felt like throwing up, and then got her a glass of water and some paper towels. On the way back to my room, I got called over by a friend down the hall.  He told me that he had just thrown up for the second time in two hours and felt awful.  This is when I realized that we might have an epidemic.  I went back to my room, scrubbed my hands clean with soap and water, and put on gloves.  I grabbed a bag, paper towels, some thermometers, and a cup of water.  I brought it back to the second patient, as he started vomiting into his trash can.  He told me to leave. At about 2:30am, I went back to bed.  There was not much more I could do, and I set my alarm for an hour later so I could check on the two patients again.  At about 3:15am, after trying to go to sleep for 45 minutes, there was another knock at my door.  It was the boyfriend of patient 3.  He told me that she wasn't feeling well, and I knew exactly what it was.  I got out of bed, climbed down my loft, grabbed a bag, some paper towels, and followed him down the hall to her room.  There she was, extremely pale and feeling extremely sick.  I left her in the care of her boyfriend, and went down the hall to check on the others.  Patient 2 was passed out.  I refilled his water, left him a new bag, checked his breathing rate, and let him sleep. I considered calling the ambulance. I woke up the other EMT on hall to ask her what to do.  She told me what she thought, and I let her sleep.  Patient 1 was in a much worse state than before.  I got to her room just as she started vomiting, and I helped her make her way to the bathroom, bringing paper towels and helping her feel comfortable.  Afterwards, she felt a lot better. I cleaned up the bowl, and I put in a new bag. I helped her back to her room, where she curled up, still in pain. I encouraged tiny sips of water about every fifteen minutes afterwards. I told her that I thought she should go to the hospital, and she told me that she did not want to.  Nobody wanted to.  I went back to my room.  I scrubbed my hands red.  I grabbed the Lysol on my shelf, and started going crazy.  I sprayed my sink, I sprayed my doorknobs. I sprayed my desk, the floor, parts of my loft. I sprayed the doors between each section of hall. The doorknobs and sinks of every bathroom, and every door leading into hall.  I sprayed the doorknobs of all the people I knew were sick, or could be sick. I discovered two new sick people as I went around disinfecting.  I got them bags, paper towels, cups of water.  I went back to my room. I scrubbed my hands red.  I went into bed.  I sent texts to the ill, telling them to text me if they need me.  I got a text from my boyfriend, telling me that he just threw up and was feeling really awful.  I got out of bed. I went down the stairs, Lysol in hand. I made sure he was okay - I brought him a bag, paper towels, water.  I let him sleep. I went back upstairs, spraying everything with Lysol - the door knobs, the railing. It was almost 5am.  I sent an e-mail to hall, but only to the residents as to not freak out the rest of the building. Hi guys, There's a really bad stomach flu going around right now. Let me know if you are feeling ill, I will try to be around. Try to stay hydrated if you can, and go to medical if you start feeling sick. Mob leaving at 7am after I give them a call. Stay healthy (and away from other human beings) -array I got three immediate messages of new sick people. I went and checked on them - I brought them bags, paper towels, water.  I lysoled their doors, their sinks, their light switches. I scrubbed my hands red.  I e-mailed the GRT's, warning them.  I e-mailed all the East Campus Medlinks, asking for help with getting Gatorade and Saltines and taking care of my residents - telling them to keep their residents away, in case this is as incredibly infectious as it seems. At 7am, I called MIT Medical Urgent Care.  I spoke to the triage nurse, and she told me what to do. I sent an e-mail to East Campus residents. Hi, I am sending a warning about a sudden-onset stomach flu that is currently floating around the east parallel. MIT urgent care recommends that students who present symptoms of nausea, diarrhea or vomiting rest and try to sip clear fluids such as water, ginger ale, gatorade or broth. Please go to urgent care if you have the following:- Vomiting/diarrhea that persists for many hours- Inability to keep fluids down- You have a fever or feel lightheaded when standing up If you are sick, please contact S^3 to get help with managing missed classes. They are going to encourage you to go to MIT Medical, but you do not need to go unless you have one of the symptoms above. As always, Urgent Care has walk-in hours 7am-11pm. You can also call 617-253-4481 at any time for medical advice. As always, dial x100 from a campus phone or 617-253-1212 for any emergency. Wash your hands! http://www.cdc.gov/handwashing/ Rachel(EC Medlink & EMT) The response was worried residents.  I told them to wash their hands, and stay in if they felt sick.  Stay away from my floor - we are quarantined for Tuesday and the foreseeable future. At this point, there were about 10 sick people on my hall.  The not-sick quickly responded - there were trips to the super market organized.  Polls were sent and taken to try and figure out where this disease came from, and how many were infected. The virus had been found to present symptoms in at least two alum, infecting outside households.  I Lysoled the doorknobs, my boyfriend, the cats. A friend of the hall and former resident made us a huge pot of chicken soup, as well as a smaller pot of vegetarian soup.  People brought us Gatorade and Saltine crackers. Other Medlinks came and brought me thermometers. I went to Urgent Care to update the triage nurse - she told me to continue what I was doing.  Check the pulse rates and the temperatures. My floor turned into an emergency room.  I went around leaving thermometers in people's faces, pouring Gatorade powder here and there.  I missed all my classes.  I started to feel sort of funny, but told myself that there were more sick people and made it go away.  The count was over 15 sick people. I ran up and down the hall over and over again checking on people, until I was forced into my room and to bed and told to calm down and go to sleep.  I scrubbed my hands red, showered, and took a two-hour nap.  I woke up, and I checked on my patients. People were starting to feel better.  It was the late afternoon, and I could see noticeable changes in mood, skin color, and overall feeling of the first patients.  They could keep down fluids and even some food, and things were looking up. I finished a problem set.  I tried and failed at studying for my exam on Friday.  I still felt a little funny, but chose to ignore it and, after putting a hosed, but healthy, senior on night duty and putting a sign on my door that I was not on shift, I scrubbed my hands red and went to sleep. Eight hours later, I woke up for class.  I went up and down the hall, checking on the patients.  There were four new patients over night.  I made sure they had Gatorade and were comfortable, and I went off to class. I went through the day in a daze, unable to focus on anything at all.  Worrying - just worrying.  I felt off - and I thought that I was doomed to come down with the virus.  I sent more warning e-mails to the Medlinks - the disease spread slightly to a couple people in the other parallel, but otherwise seemed to be winding down.  I got a nice e-mail of thanks from the Medlinks director.  I made an appointment with student support services for the next day.  I freaked out over a problem set that I thought was due that day. It was due the next day, Thursday. I did the problem set.  I felt off.  I did a case study for marketing. I tried and failed to study for my test on Friday. This is not my week. I went to sleep.  There were no knocks on my door, no frightening texts or calls in the middle of the night. I woke up, I went to class. I met with my awesome student support services officer.  I got an extension on my test. I went through the rest of my day in a daze, and I identified the source of my haziness to a new medication I was trying out.  I stopped taking it.  Things are clearer now. One new patient, patient number 20.  It has been over 24 hours since a new person has presented symptoms.  I hope this is over. I learned a few things over the past five days.  First of all, I really like being an EMT and Medlink.  Even though it was torturous at times, I really did like being there for my friends, and I think it is important that people have someone to go to when they are not feeling well.  I know that if I was sick I would want somebody checking on me, and I am glad that I can be there for other people. Second, my community is really awesome.  My hall really came together in the rough times - making soup, bringing Gatorade and crackers to the doors of the ill.  It is amazing how generous and kind these people are, and I am so happy I live here. All along, the cats provided great emotional support, and probably helped with the spreading of disease.  A few weeks ago, I started seeing Staceyann Chin's face in the Infinite. MIT SAFER^2 was advertising a "One Night Stand for Student Rights," a night of spoken word, collective art, and informative camaraderie. I read Chin's book about five years ago, and was madly into it at the time. She's equally (and differently) impressive in person. The whole night was exhilarating. DarkMatter, a queer South Asian performance and literary arts duo, raged onstage against imperialism, white supremacy, and sexism, and when we in the audience (everyone in the audience) clapped and hollered, the response felt more sincere than any applause I've heard in months. It heartened me to be in that room, with the coolest collection of people and poets and activists, and to see students caring about social justice instead of problem sets for a night. The week continued. I published my first post on CoLab Radio, a planning blog started by the MIT Community Innovators Lab. I'm a guest editor this spring. Expect more.   Read the first installment in my series on urban wilderness. Ta-Nehisi Coates, my writing professor and mentor, gave a beautiful and devastating* reading of a work in progress. *I choose the word 'devastating' because during the Q&A following the reading, it was used at least twice in response. Ta-Nehisi's writing is light and powerful, ("You can tell he's a poet," said a friend afterward) but his subject matter--systemic injustice, white supremacy and imperialism, human loss--is heavy. "Devastatingly beautiful," someone said, but also just devastating.  I read some great things for classes: "Fifth Avenue, Uptown," "The Greater Common Good." I spent a lot of time in the GIS (Geographic Information Systems) Lab making maps. Somehow, between classes, cooking, and solo field trips to Jamaica Pond, I spent an afternoon in the pottery studio.    In other news, one of my favorite people at MIT left this week for a semester away. I made this goodbye cake, a chocolate-raspberry layer cake, as a farewell gesture. I added a tier for grandeur and skipped over some of the steps involving patience. Layers slid and ganache puddled, but a cakeslide is less dangerous than a landslide, and no one minded the pools of chocolate.    We have something to tell you - with a little help from the bloggers:     I sometimes refer to myself as Granny because of my propensity to:a.) bake cookies b.) ask for help with technology andc.) comfortingly listen to peoples troubles.

This is home to a post office, dry cleaners, the ID card office, and most importantly, the Latino Cultural Center's office and lounge. It may feel somewhat eerie the first time you go down there (maybe it's just a basement thing), but after being officially involved on the LCC board for a semester, it's become that place where I go in between classes to have a cup of coffee, get going on my to do list, take a nap, or just catch up with people. Depending on the late-night energy, sometimes this involves people serenading each other with a mariachi hat and jacket.  We even decorate it nicely for the holidays, see?                                    In any case, the LCC exists simply to promote and support all of the Latino organizations on campus, which include MAES (focuses on professional development and outreach), LUChA (focuses on culture and academics), Casino Rueda (instruction and performances of different salsa dance styles), APR (association of Puerto Rican students), SHPE (Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers), and Mujeres Latinas (Latina Women).  We, together with the groups mentioned above, organize events such as Cena a Las Seis (Dinner at 6), which happen(s)/ed during parent's weekend in October.... (& By the way, meet Franky '15. I met him during CPW a number of years ago that I won't bother to calculate for the sake of not feeling old. Here he is scolding me for not blogging in an eternity...)                                                   Back to Cena a las Seis, though. The whole MIT community including parents are always invited. This year's was pretty fantastic. Except for the part where we ran out of food towards the end. (No, I am not responsible.) But hey, at least even if you didn't get to eat everything you wanted, you still got a show! Here is Diana R '15, (prez of the LCC) doing some ballet folklorico.                                               Usually it's held in Walker Memorial, the same building where a significant number of exams are held (on a higher floor). The change of mood is quite interesting. :)  Ready for this? Now jump to this weekend, to Sabrosura, a night of dancing and food for the kickoff of the LCC's Mes Latino. Basically, for the month of March we actively promote Latino organizations' activities and host Festival de Las Americas-- an event where all kinds of trivia and information about Latin American culture (and need I say food...) are shared with the whole MIT community. Festival this year will be on 3/14. (*smirks amusedly for not realizing it was on pi day until now*) We also host study breaks and review sessions!  That's the LCC in a nutshell. I'm happy to be a part of such a vibrant, truly supportive community that occasionally feeds me tortillas and elotes when mi mamita is so far away.  I will leave you with a summary of Sabrosura in only 4 points:  1. The exec board got creative.    2. THIS.   3. Casino Rueda taught us how to dance.   4. And a good time was had by all.

I know what you're thinking: "what else is new?" You yawn and ask whether I salivate and breathe while reading Paradise Lost.  I know, I know! But read this description of our home planet in Book II and you'll see what I mean: "And fast by hanging in a golden chainThis pendent world in bigness as a starOf smallest magnitude close by the moon." (II.1051-3) I'm not sure what Milton means by "magnitude." In astronomy, we use the word "magnitude" to describe how bright an object is. Milton could definitely have known that technical term, because he spent a lot of time talking with Galileo. "Magnitude" here could also have meant "importance." The term could be ambiguous by design, since Milton is fond of wordplay and double meaning. Regardless of his intention, when I read that passage I saw this in my mind:  That's a photograph of our little blue "pendant world," close by the moon and somewhere near the bigness of a star. There's no golden chain to be seen, although I suppose you could think of the chain as a metaphor for our ecosystem's fragility. The Cassini spacecraft snapped that picture last year and, although it's only made up of two little fuzzy blobs, I personally think it's one of the most beautiful pictures ever taken in astronomy.  Here's another one (context: Satan is traveling to Heaven) "Down right into the world's first region throwsHis flight precipitant and winds with easeThrough the pure marble air his oblique wayAmongst innumerable stars that shone--Stars distant, but nigh hand seemed other worlds." (III.563-6) Spot on! In 1992, Alex Wolszczan and Dale Frail discovered the very first planets outside our solar system - "extrasolar planets", or "exoplanets" - orbiting a pulsar. I've had interactions with both of these dudes: I attended a talk by Wolszczan about a year ago (at this conference) and I was visiting the National Radio Astronomy Observatory in Socorro NM when Dale Frail gave a teatime presentation about the discovery of FRBs (Fast Radio Bursts...very unfortunately nicknamed "furbies" by some astronomers). I borrowed a few papers from Dale, didn't realize he needed them back that evening, took them with me on a field trip, then found out through a phone call that Dale really wanted his papers back since he was about to leave town. Mortified, I had to sprint across the VLA to hand the papers back to Dale, who happened to be on-site. AHHHH! Anyway, the study of extrasolar planets is now one of the hottest sub-fields in astronomy. Professors Sara Seager and Josh Winn are spearheading efforts at MIT, and TESS is going to revolutionize our big-picture of these other worlds. Recently, a study predicted that 20% of all sun-like stars in our galaxy have an Earth-sized planet in the habitable zone (the "goldilocks zone" - not too close to the star and hot, not too far away and cold). "Is in the habitable zone" is a very different thing from "habitable," and "habitable" is a very different thing from "inhabited," but it's still very exciting stuff.  There are many more instances in Paradise Lost of Milton's astronomy interest (including the phrase "glazed optic tube" for "telescope") but I'll finish off with a discussion of light. Ultimately, astronomy is about collecting light. Our eyes are pretty good detectors, so for many centuries astronomers relied on them. For example, when Galileo stuck his eye at the end of a telescope, photons from Europa, Ganymede, Callisto, and Io entered his eye after traveling ~800,000 kilometers across the solar system - and voila! Galileo literally saw the moons of Jupiter. Nowadays, we can do much better than human sight by building increasingly advanced cameras. We can even "see" invisible light, by building detectors designed to make sense of radio light, x-ray light, infrared light, etc. When John Milton wrote PL, he was completely blind. Presumably because of that, the blind narrator of PL (who I'm not convinced is Milton himself) takes detours from storytelling to discuss the nature of light and sight, and I think it's totally fascinating that he chooses to discuss astronomy and telescopes at all. One major idea presented is that light has an eternal-physical duality: the essence of light is eternal, and it is a manifestation of that essence that we see as a shining beam. Nowadays, of course, we would say that light has wave-particle duality, and that in a way a particle we detect is a manifestation of the wave, but Milton hadn't taken 8.04 so it would have been kind of unreasonable to expect that from him. I think that the blind Milton found comfort in the idea that we don't need eyes to detect the essence of light, and that even the best telescopes can't protect us from every kind of shroud. For example, a good liar can deceive even the sharpest detectors. In Book III, God's right-hand sharp-sighted angel Uriel is deceived by Satan in disguise, and the result of this deceit is that Uriel gives Satan directions to the Garden of Eden. This inspires the blind Milton narrator to pray to light for a deeper kind of sight, in my favorite passage of the book so far: "...celestial Light,Shine inward and the mind through all her powersIrradiate. There plant eyes. All mist from thencePurge and disperse, that I may see and tellOf things invisible to mortal sight!" (III.51-5) Some of you may be wondering why I dropped off the face of the blogosphere shortly after going French. That story has three parts. It begins with not having enough time to pee, then moves to my poetry class, and culminates in a hardware hackathon. 1. The Time-to-Pee Schedule Metric When I was putting together my Freshman Spring schedule on the wonderful planner.mit.edu, I quickly noticed that my schedule would have a very low time-to-pee. What is time-to-pee? It's a metric I made up for gauging schedule packed-ness, and works quite simply. First, count up the number of classes (recitations, lectures, labs) you have every day. Then, for each class, answer the question, "Do I have time to go to the bathroom before my next class?" The number of "yes" answers to that question divided by the number of classes is your time-to-pee. A time-to-pee close to 1 indicates a loosely-packed schedule; the lower your time-to-pee, the tighter the schedule. My current schedule consists of the following classes: 16.00 -- Introduction to Aerospace Engineering7.013 -- Introductory Biology6.041 -- Probabilistic Systems AnalysisCMS.100 -- Introduction to Media Studies21W.762 -- Poetry Workshop  I have 16 classes total throughout the week and 7 times to pee--once after my last class every day, and after 7.013 on Tuesdays and Thursdays. That gives me a fairly low time-to-pee of 0.4375. Yikes. Last semester, my favorite time to blog was between classes, so rename the time-to-pee metric as "time-to-blog" and--well, that's my excuse for being so absent. The low time-to-pee is especially compounded when I have Intro Media Studies (green) in Building 1 and Poetry Workshop (red) in Building 66, on the other side of campus. Every Tuesday and Thursday I can be found sprinting across Killian Court to get to poetry on time. But that leads me to the next part of this story. 2. "There is poetry in it." -- William Corbett William Corbett is the teacher of poetry workshop, indubitably my favorite class this semester (though media studies takes a close second). We've spent the last 3 weeks of class just reading and discussing poetry--one poem chosen by each student, in a class of about 30 students. And as it turns out, poetry takes many forms. We've so far seen everything from "chestnut" poem "The Road Not Taken" by Robert Frost to Billy Collins' coming-of-age poem "On Turning Ten" to childhood favorites by Dr. Seuss and Shel Silverstein to music by Bob Marley, Tupac Shakur, and the Red Hot Chili Peppers. Each one leads to discussions about maturity, childhood, war, the inherent nature of humankind. Poetry is a philosophical and dynamic sort of art--sometimes incisive, often ambiguous, steeped in imagery and atmosphere narrated by ageless voices. Take the introduction of "The Fall of Rome" by W. H. Auden:      The piers are pummelled by the waves;     In a lonely field the rain     Lashes an abandoned train;     Outlaws fill the mountain caves. Four simple lines, and a montage of images--lashing rain, piers, abandoned tran in lonely field, outlaws, mountain caves--swell to life in the imagination. I've been posting my favorite poems from the class on my Tumblr, and I'll continue doing so. We start writing our own poems in class next week, so I might put up some of my own work throughout the semester. Stay tuned. 3. The Romanticism of Hacking I blogged last semester about a hackathon I attended as a photographer-and-observer, and I expressed a wish to one day participate in one myself. That day has come. Over last two weekends, I said something along the lines of "yolo" and decided to attend MakeMIT, MIT's first ever hardware hackathon. Though the sleep deficit it gave me meant I was exhausted for about two weeks (to which I also attribute my blogging hiatus), it was one of the best decisions I've made while at MIT. 3D printers, laser cutters, and soldering irons galore (courtesy Formlabs and MakerBot). Raspberry Pis and Arduinos everywhere. Tables of linear actuators from Rise Robotics and the new XBox Kinects from Microsoft. Rapid prototyping and even-more-rapid sifting of piles of resistors, looking back and forth from a resistor color code reference sheet.  MakeMIT took place over two weekends (unconventional for a hackathon--but this was a "hardware hackathon," so exceptions were made). On Saturday, February 15, from 9:00 AM to 11:00 PM, students from all over Boston hacked their way through the day. The top ten teams would win a chance to compete again the following weekend on February 22, with access to more materials and the MIT Hobby Shop machining tools. The top three teams would win cash prizes. "Make something you wish existed," said one of the sponsors. And so it happened. One team built Lexo Glove, a motorized glove designed to translate text into American Sign Language hand movements. Another build an entirely mechanical puzzle box that only opened when placed on a table and spun. Yet another build an LED matrix for playing Flappy Bird. My team built Jukelele, an electric guitar about the size of a paperback copy of Atlas Shrugged, with an extendable fretboard so that pitch depended on how much the fretboard was extended. We started with just two people, including myself. It started with an array of resistors on a small piece of foam posterboard.  By the end of the day, we had a working fretboard (which works essentially like a specialized voltage divider) wired up to some switches (one to "pluck" each guitar string) and an Arduino, all being fed into a Pure Data program that read the voltage from each wire and played a very crude note in response. To our very great surprise, the judges decided we were top ten material and selected us for a big two-minute (and fairly sleepy) final presentation, and then we were on for Phase II. Below, you can see the fretboard prototype in my left hand during our presentation, and some bits of the Pure Data visual program on the projector in the back. Courtesy MakeMIT/TechX For Phase II we realized that we were very short on hands. Teams were supposed to be 3-5 people, and we only had two. My teammate emailed a few mailing lists asking for people to join us, and by the next week we'd solicited some extra help to join us. As Saturday rolled by, we swapped out our switchboard for real guitar strings wired up to a certain voltage ("pulled high" is a phrase I learned this weekend) and activated by "plucking" with a metal pick wired to ground. We shortened all our wires, zip-tied everything together, wired on some pin headers, and shoved everything into a little project box about the size of two palms for a small, ukelele-size form factor (form factor is another phrase I learned this weekend). The fretboard went onto a drawer slide tied to string wound around an encoder (a method for measuring distance), and the Arduino connected to a more sophisticated Pure Data program I spent all day developing while my teammates worked mostly on the hardware components. I'll post pictures when MakeMIT uploads pictures from Phase II. It is literally mind-blowing to think that just two weeks ago we sat down with a very vague idea--"pocket-sized electric guitar!"--and as of this weekend, it exists. That's crazy. And it takes a hackathon to really understand that. And, despite being intimidated at my freshman-level skill set, it turns out that when you dedicate an entire day to one project you can get a lot done. My teammates and I learned Pure Data totally from scratch, and when the room is pretty much overflowing with free equipment and electronic parts to use, well, you can pretty much become a Master Builder, LEGO-style, in the space of a single afternoon. This story has a postscript. During Phase I, I was working at a soldering station when I overheard a conversation taking place at the next table between two hackers. 1: Hey, that looks intense! What are you working on?2: Oh, I'm not really a hacker--I'm just here helping my boyfriend's team...I'm trying to follow this picture he drew me to connect these things. He's waiting in line for something, so I'm working on this... Two things struck me about that. First, going into the hackathon, I probably had about the same skillset in terms of hardware and electronics as that girl helping her boyfriend. Second, no assumptions at all were made about her--despite her insistence of being "not really a hacker," to everyone else, she was a hacker just like them, working on a project just as awesome as theirs.  That conversation stuck with me, and I suppose taking a poetry class at the same time spun up some gears in my mind and got me thinking that (1) engineering can have its own flavor of romanticism and dating life, and (2) women really shouldn't be afraid or intimidated to pursue engineering. It's significant, I think, that this conversation occurred with a male hacker's girlfriend, while if the second person had been a female hacker's boyfriend the story would probably have been a rarer one. I decided to write a poem to try to reflect these points--you can read "On Loving an Engineer" on my Tumblr. That's all for now--stay tuned, because classes are picking up, airplanes are being built, and the snow continues falling on the frozen fields of MIT. ~Allan This semester has been quite quiet so far - just how I like it.  And by quiet, I mean crazy, of course.  I live on Tetazoo, after all. I passed my EMT class during IAP, and then the state practical exam last week.  All that is left is the national exam, which I am taking within the next couple weeks.  Wish me luck!  I have been studying a lot and I really hope I do okay - I've been really nervous! But I am taking it with my good friend Claire L. '17, and I know that we have it in ourselves to do well.  We just have to show the world! Other than all the stress of passing EMT exams, I am trying to take a less stressful courseload, and so far it has been okay.  I am taking one technical class, 3.022, or Microstructural Evolution of Materials.  It is all about materials on the microstructural scale.  I am still a bit confused about what we are learning and what the class is about, which is a bit concerning given that my first exam is next week.  I have been studying what we've learned in class and doing all the problem sets super early, so I hope it goes okay! Other than 3.022, I am working on my management minor with 15.812 and 15.501, or Marketing and Accounting.  I really enjoy these classes, and I can see myself continuing to take many more management classes in the future.  The professors are really incredible - and they are also super interested in us as students, and I want to get to know them more throughout the semester.  My accounting professor even has lunches with his students, and I hope that I can attend one eventually! I am also taking two HASS classes this semester, 21W.762 and 21L.430.  21W.762 is a poetry workshop class with the poet and author William Corbet, and he is really awesome.  He brings in new poetry books for us each week and postcards, and he always has new witty comments to make on our comments on different poems or lyrics.  The other class, 21L.430, is Popular Narratives of the Sixties, taught by the East Campus Housemaster, Kate Delaney.  Kate and Tom Delaney are retiring and moving to Hawaii after this semester, and when I found that out I knew that I needed to take a Delaney class before they left.  The class has been really cool so far - we read and watched Catch-22, talked about what defines the sixties, and watched Dr. Strangelove.  All were interesting novels and movies and I am excited to read the rest of the books and watch the rest of the movies for the class. So there is a quick update on my life.  I am still a Medlink and I am still an EMT, but I am no longer attending pistol practice or working as many hours as a Tour Guide and Career Services desk worker or UROPing in order to focus more on my academics.   Anyway, now I want to show you pictures of cute animals and other things that I have seen around MIT, whether it is in my dorm or around campus.  Here you go. Cats Galileo:  Derp Cat:  Thor:  Muffin:  Snowy MIT That's right, I've been running around campus every time it snows screaming, "IT'S SO PRETTY!!!"   (My creepy shot of these people building a really pretty snowman)  The Cooking/Baking I've been cooking and baking a lot lately, and our vegetarian co-op is just starting up again on my hall!  Each week, pairs of people cook and serve a vegetarian meal to a group of about 12 people who live on my hall. I cook for the first time tomorrow! My friend Marvin R. '16 and I are making a bean casserole dish that is supposed to be really tasty! Over the past few weeks I have made a pretty quiche:  And a beautiful strawberry pie:  They were both really good. I am proud of myself! My New Friend  This is my new squishable Batty!!  He comforts me during stressful times.  I got him as a mystery squishable during one of my friend's orders.  MIT Excellence Awards Chris Peterson and I got to go on stage and receive MIT Excellence Awards today!   I went on stage with many other members of MIT EMS to receive the first Collier Medal.  It was a great honor and although I did not know Sean Collier (the officer who was shot on duty last April on MIT campus) personally, many people in the service did and it was incredible to see how appreciative the MIT community was of our service and the many hours we volunteer each year. Chris Peterson won a different award - the Innovative Solutions award!  The presenter mentioned his awesome work with creating the MIT Imagination admissions video and his dedication to MIT students as a senior admissions officer. I am extremely happy that he received this award.  Chris Peterson is such an incredible person and he absolutely deserves it.  After he was named as the recipient at the ceremony, I e-mailed this blurry picture of him to our admissions bloggers mailing list, and within a couple of hours there were 25+ replies congratulating Petey and just being so immensely proud of our friend.  Again, I am really happy that Petey received this award - he is the master of innovation, and a really awesome person :) see complete archives  My sophomore fall I took an STS (science, technology, and society) writing class with Sherry Turkle, STS.043 (Technology and Self: Science, Technology and Memoir). The main takeaway, which I am going to play with here, was that our memories can be more accessible when we write around the objects attached to them. Here are the things on and around my desk and also me, some of the people I care about, and this past year.    Figure 1: My desk and some of the trinkets on it. When I started college most of these were from home. Now most of them are more recent. Bottom left: Bottom right:    Figure 2: Tea and more trinkets. Bottom right and top: Bottom left:  Figure 3: The corkboards above my desk.  Figure 4: Another corkboard, to the left of my desk. This one is larger. It holds my jewelry and more papers. It used to hold more small trinkets, but I never put them back after moving back to Random last semester. Theyre currently in my desk drawer. Almost all the jewelry is gifts from my grandparents from their travels before my grandfather died.  Figure 5: A frog Max painted for me before I left for college, when he was 8 and I was 18, and probably my favorite thing out of all the non-living things in my room. Weve had frogs as pets since I was tiny.  Figure 6: The view to the right of my desk.  Figure 7: The view from outside. My room is at the end of a hallway that includes the most commonly used junction between the two buildings that make up Random Hall. If my door is open I get to see everyone that passes by, and this is what they see from the other side. And I think I might go paint one now. Have a wonderful Tuesday.  :) Here are some more desks and study spaces to visit: Im perched on the top step of the super-architected Stata amphitheater, a little blinded by the brightness of sun and snow. In searching for a place to sit, I named the following constraints: that I must sit outside, that there must be light, that I must have a dry seat and a wifi connection. I didnt think about the temperature, so my fingers are almost too cold to type, but hey, thats the outside for you. The class I took over IAP was about designing with constraints. It was about making your own rules and following them unswervingly. 4.11A: Architecture and Environmental Design Intensive is a month-long class with an enormous studio component. I took it for context. My department, Urban Studies and Planning, is within the same school as Architecture, and while there are some overlapping courses and professors, so far, I hadnt investigated architecture. If Im going to study the built environment, I figure I should share some background with the people who make it. In lecture, we learned principles of design: rhythm, scale, proportion. We watched the Eames Classic Powers of Ten and read about harmony, structure, and the golden ratio. We had guest lectures from Anne Whiston Spirn, my advisor, and Marie Law Adams of Landing Studio.   	In studio, we measured and traced and cut and built and did it all over and over again. We set rules and followed them painstakingly, constructing careful abstractions of human proportion and movement. At times, it was frustrating. At times, I felt forced to adhere to arbitrary rules I didnt understand, and the profound interpretations we were expected to come up with felt like b.s. or exercises in covering your tracks after messing up. But then I could see, in my own projects and in my classmates, how the constraints had not choked creativity. They had permitted it. 	Twice during the semester we presented our work in the form of a review. Each student displayed his or her drawings and models and gave a short presentation to a panel of architects, students and faculty, followed by questioning that could feel like either casual conversation or interrogation. The panel evaluated our craftsmanship, our methods, the rigor of our thought and decision-making processes. It looked like this.  Grace Park (Wellesley, 2016) explains her models to an audience of architecture students and faculty. 	   They listen intently. 	   Grace's final project, disassembled. 	   Anthony Kawecki (MIT, 2017) points to his work from early in the month. 	   Justin Cheung (MIT, 2016) demonstrates the interactive movement of his wood cube. 	   Piper Lim (MIT, 2017) has everyone's attention. 	Last time I posted about architecture, some people got riled up. Some people thought that it was too artsy, shallow, superficial. Too unscientific. It's true that architecture is not a hard science. It's not a pursuit of truth. There are no proofs or controlled experiments. The architecture major at MIT is notorious among undergrads for two things: abstractness and difficulty. The architecture students work harder than most of us and sleep less. MIT is an engineering school, but that fact shouldn't relegate other disciplines to low status. Design is not solely aesthetic. Good design takes rigorous thinking. It takes compromise, comprehension, good craftsmanship. I'm not an architect, and this class didn't make me one. What we did was just practice. 	From the department website: 	"Architecture was one of the four original departments at MIT, and it was the first signal that MIT would not be narrowly defined in science and technology. Through recognition of architecture as a liberal discipline, the Department has long contributed to learning in the arts and humanities at MIT.	The Department is committed to a concern for human values and for finding appropriate roles for architecture in society. It is a place where individual creativity is cultivated and nurtured in a framework of values that are humanistically, socially, and environmentally responsible." 	Technological advances should be accompanied by innovation in design. Otherwise, we're stuck living among anachronisms. 	What do you think? What are your thoughts on architecture, craft, the intersections of design and STEM in general? There are two things MIT students lovepunts and puzzles. What a puzzle isthats pretty straightforward. A punt is more intricate, and is typically often used as a verb. It refers to an action or a series of actions an MIT student performs, one that usually leads to statements like, I had to stay up all night working on that (favorite expletive) p-set." Punts take various shapes, from kittens meowing on Youtube to the entire Saw Franchise to baking cookies to video gamesand in my case, to devising these potentially senseless punt puzzles. It all began when I logged into an online page for my Electromagnetism Class and saw the p-set. After staring at the problems for a couple of minutes, my mind folded into several lazy layers, and this punt-promoting idea sprouted like a savior. So, what you have before you, folks, is a punt puzzle. I dont know how easy or difficult it is, but I expect thatwhether you're a casual reader, current applicant or unusually developed rhinocerosyou can probably solve it with some help or maybe even independently. At your disposal, the internet, your brains chugging and fizzing, the comments section, your fellow commenters and my occasional check-in to bemoan your exponential progress or laugh maniacally at your crawling pace. That probably suffices for now. Let the games begin!! *** Er...I was expecting a fancy cloud of smoke and all such after that last line, but, um, yeah, lets...lets start *** Greetings, and welcome.

Questions, clarifications, ideas, solutions in the comments! I'll be swooping around periodically like a hawk. Have fun (hopefully)! Its some ungodly hour of the day and I feel pretty tired. Im probably one of the last few people awake, and will soon be crawling to my bed to hug my pillow. Theres something absolutely beautiful about pillows, isnt there? Theyre huge and squishy, and dont squirm away if you hug them. Not sure if that last sentence was full of wisdom or just plain sad. Anyway, three full weeks of the Spring Semester have sped away, three expectedly busy weeks. Ive gotten sick for a brief period, seen hundreds of vines, turned in seven p-sets and two essays, played Cards Against Humanity, traveled, written stories and had my first midterm (the meaning of midterm is fatally lost on MIT). Theres a lot that happens, and I think I sunk a bit too deeply into the Institute these past few weeksthat is to say, Ive been floating around in the bubble built around classes, my dorm and my frat, and it seems like I havent really seen much of anything else. Im not jaded thoughfar from it. Classes this semester have been challenging as always, and my social circle has actually expanded, allowing me to meet some absolutely awesome peopleAritro I see you. My most fun p-set thus far has been with my programming class (6.00). We had to make a game of Hangman using Python. Thankfully, my roommate is also taking the class and we were able to test-run each others codes and see how well they work. This actually helped reveal a few glitches on both ends. And speaking of debuggingAnother kind of debugging had to take place, one that resulted in a poem that waxed philosophical about bodily fluids. Half of Alpha Delta Phi was down with the stomach bug in a matter of days. E-mail threads about booked toilets and an ultimate poetry contest on who could most eloquently describe the writhing, plopping sounds tearing through intestines reigned. But as bad as it was, it was also a chance to see brothers of the house at their best. Lots of volunteers brought in tons of food and water, helped the sick run errands (turning in p-sets and the like), prepared soup for everyone. It shouldnt be too easy to forget that behind dark clouds lies the moon. WritingI know I havent blogged in a while (yes, yes, I feel the mass of your judgmental stares poking my back) but Ive actually been writing a lot. In fact, in between classes and p-sets, it seems to be all I want to do, and at a higher frequency than I did last semester. The stories havent really changed their somewhat dark, gritty feel, but I think Im also learning more about the kind of storyteller I want to be, the kind of storyteller I possibly could be. High school was a period of full bloom for me. I had torrents of ideas, ranging from the asinine to the serviceable. They swirled around my head, people and events and timelines, snippets of universes waiting to be painted, and I just wanted to flood them out of my head and onto paper. So I did. I wrote often, filling roughly two thousand pages with fiction over a five-year timespan. This deluge of need and motivation was somewhat missing last semester. I still wroteI had the blogs (for which Im always grateful) and I had a bunch of stories, but the feeling wasnt as overpowering as it used to be. But this makes sense right? It was my first semester here. I was trying to find my ground, trying to adjust to classes and a terrible, terrible, just plain cold and terrible new and refreshing climate. This semester, theres been a lot more of that inspirational outpour, and I hope I do write more.These are excerpts from a bunch of old stories: He jolted, sitting up straight at once, looking around. He saw the shape almost immediately, took three crawling steps backward and rose. Fifteen feet away stood Randolph Lander, Jasons dad, slowly covering the distance between them. He held a flashlight in his right hand, its light pointed at Andys chest.  What do you want? snarled Andrew. Stay away from me!    No, she repeated weakly. He reached for her one last time. She thought to slap him as his hands moved; so fast they moved she barely realized it. A loud crack. His hands snapped her neck in one clean go. She was dead before she could move to slap, falling to the ground in a clumsy heap.   At that time of my life, my dad worked in a meatpacking plant (he always came home smelling of cattle blood and I didnt like it). My mom and her friend worked as tailors near the clutter of strip malls. Aunt Martha often walked me to schoola twenty-minute walk that involved lots of long, grim alleyways and roads flanked by teetering ramshackle buildings. In particular, there was this path that branched off in two directions, one meeting a graffiti-heavy stone wall, the other cutting across a fenced field from which the walls of my school were visible. It was at the edge of this field Aunt Martha often left, hurrying back to look after Grandpa, and I began thinking of the branching alleyway that led to the field as the Valley of Death.   I got hit in the head; TWICE!...at Bad Taste 2014. "Bad Taste" is the somewhat infamous no-holds-barred event put on by the Chorallaries every spring. It took place this past weekend in 26-100, one of MITs biggest lecture halls, and opened with a...flying piece of paper. Actually, rolls. Flying rolls of toilet paper, numbering hundreds. I was trying to find a seat amid a crossfire of paper when I was struck on the head. The world spun for a second and I nearly lost my footing. Minutes later, I was howling in laughter at some of the absolutely ridiculous statements drawn up on the chalkboards. The front of the room slowly got clogged with a mass of toilet paper as people tried to hit every performer for every second of the show. Before it beganat slightly past midnighta mini-war raged. The Soldiers of The Back Seats kept hurling rolls of toilet paper at the front seat Ninjas. Somehow, I didnt get hit too much. I had to duck a lot, and even tried my luck at grabbing two rolls of paper and shooting them backwards over my head. Anyway, I have the enviable throwing skills of a brain-dead chimpanzee so they probably didnt hit anyone. The Chorallaries performed shortly afterwards, going through skits, songs and readings that rang of what the event was all about. I dont want to say much else about it. I know opinions overall were mixed, but I had a lot of fun. And if you ever want to a chuckle, find a way to get the list of 101 Things MIT Students Are Bad At. Can you guess any items on the list? Te AmoLove is one of those huge, defining tenets of life that no one ever really explains well. Thats why I decided to take Philosophy of Love (CC.112) this semester. Its definitely one of my favorite classes, comprising just about nine or ten students.  We basically sit around a sleek table and discuss...well, love. We began by discussing songs we felt described the feeling of love, or at least really tried to. Everyone had to turn in a song, and naturally, I turned in All Too Well by Taylor Swift. There were lots of discussions about the similarities and differences between the songs, and what that said about our perceptions of love. Then we read a pretty tragic love story and watched the old classic movie Casablanca. We also read about love from a fairly clinical, psychological standpoint: The Road Less Traveled by Scott Peck. It was really insightful, if not highly cynical of the typical view of love. Peck basically reduced most common notions of lovelove at first sight, the implicit sweetness of self-sacrifice, the arising feeling of dependencyto illusions, but always with measured thinking. Right now, we have two reading assignments that Im yet to make great progress on (thanks to another upcoming midterm and two p-sets). The reading assignments are both novels, which means Ill have to pick up the pace. Its a reading- and writing-intensive class, but its also very discussion-based. Its always interesting to hear what other MIT students have to say about love. A severely logical environment almost always seems to breed cynics on issues like this, but there are a lot of hopeful, sentimental takes on what love is, what it could mean, why we could want it, but always with the usual dash of logic. The class really lets you take charge of how you process the material, and despite being a lot of work, its also a tremendous lot of fun. The other classes Im taking this semester are 6.00, 18.02, 8.02 and CC.111. The last one is a concourse Friday Seminar, in which we get to have great discussions (last week, it was one on the significance of the statue of Augustus Caesar). Ill try to blog more about the classes as the semester goes by, but 8.02Electricity and Magnetismis definitely my hardest class thus far. I spent about sixteen hours on last weeks p-set, which I think was just unusually difficult. The p-set from this week proved less tasking, but who can really predict these things? Overall, theres still a lot going on, and Im still trying to get a deep sense of what this semester will be like. But what with stomach bugs and hackathons and Winter Olympics hacks and events like Bad Taste, Im pretty sure that something exciting is just around a really close corner.  You: Where are you from?Me: London.You: But you...you don't...you don't seem to have a British accent.Me: Correct. Let me explain! I was born in Singapore, had a Singaporean accent, then moved to London during the summer before fifth... read more  see complete archives  Last semester, I took my first music class at MIT: 21M.235, or "Monteverdi to Mozart". 21M.235 is offered in the fall, and as you might guess it focuses on music spanning from Monteverdi (ca. 1600) to Mozart (ca. 1800). In the spring, a class called 21M.250 ("Beethoven to Mahler", for you words people) takes up the baton and covers music spanning from Beethoven (a Mozart contemporary) to Mahler (ca. 1910).  I loved having a class that taught me to listen, and was all set to take 21M.250 this semester -- until I found out that it conflicts with one of my physics classes. My friend Ben H. '14 was in a similarly tragic situation: he took 21M.235 with me, wanted to take 21M.250, but had a conflict.  What were two music nerds to do? We e-mailed Professor Neff, the WONDERFUL wonderful professor who in the past few years has taught 21M.011 (Introduction to Western Music), 21M.235, 21M.250, and 21M.295 (American Popular Music). "Professor Neff!" we (digitally) cried. "We were hoping to take Beethoven to Mahler, since we really enjoyed Monteverdi to Mozart last semester. Unfortunately we both have class conflicts." We were wondering, we continued, "whether there might be any opportunities to listen to the music ourselves and discuss it with you." "Hello!" Professor Neff replied, fewer than ten minutes later (I mentioned that she's wonderful, right?) "That sounds wonderful to me!" As a result of that e-mail exchange, I now spend one hour each Thursday afternoon with Ben and Prof. Neff. We meet in a little room in the Music Library, that has three comfy armchairs and a big TV. This week, I learned that to be a great composer in ~1800 Vienna you had to excel at writing symphonies, string quartets, AND operas. I was unsurprised to learn that Mozart made the cut, but was shocked to learn that Beethoven didn't. In Vienna, Prof. Neff told us, Beethoven was known as a pianist and not as a composer. I was also shocked to learn that Beethoven may have met Mozart. I'm not sure how to describe why this seems so strange to me, but it's something like this: each of those composers is, in my mind, an abstract idea and not a human being. The idea of them interacting is just bizarre.  But yes, apparently Beethoven went to Vienna in order to work with Mozart. There's controversy in the music history community about whether and for how long they actually met (an afternoon? a week?) but for some reason their partnership never took off. Beethoven went to study under Haydn instead (ahh! more weird spacetime collisions!) and there's a lot less controversy about the fact that their student-teacher relationship existed for years and was a complete disaster. Also a disaster, at least initially, was Beethoven's one and only opera Fidelio. Apparently insensitive to current events, Beethoven tried to produce an opera about wrongful imprisonment for a French-occupied Vienna. His primarily French soldier audience was not amused the first time he tried to put it on, and they were not amused the second time he tried to put it on. By the third attempt, Napoleon was gone and Fidelio was much more well-received. (Is there anyone else out there who had NO IDEA that Beethoven wrote an opera, or was that just me?) We spent the first ten minutes of class or so watching and listening to a scene from Fidelio (notable because four characters express four very different emotions using the exact same melody, in a round) and the last ten minutes listening to the Sonata Pathetique. I didn't recognize the name of the piece, but my ears recognized the melody and apparently my fingers did, too: I had the ghostly experience of feeling them begin to move on their own accord. I was suddenly very certain that I played that piece as a kid.  Muscle memory is a magical phenomenon, and so are professors who are happy and excited to do an extra hour of teaching per week, just for fun.  I will always remember John Milton's 400th birthday: December 9, 2008. I was a junior in High School. In the morning, Mr. Potchatek got up on a table in the English pod with an apple in one hand and a copy of Paradise Lost in the other, and I don't think he got down again until he had read the entire book out loud from start to finish.  Here at MIT, Professor Mary Fuller teaches a renown Paradise Lost seminar in the spring. Every spring, I try to fit Paradise Lost into my schedule, and every spring I fail. The thing is, it's very difficult to get through any literature class without stumbling across a reference to Paradise Lost and feeling embarrassed about the fact that you haven't read the original text. Tragically, my Old English class conflicts with Prof. Fuller's course this semester.  "That's tragic, Anna!" Professor Bahr replied, fewer than ten minutes later, and then: "I'd be happy to read it with you."  As a result of that e-mail exchange, I now spend one hour each Thursday afternoon with Prof. Bahr (immediately after hanging out with Prof. Neff and Ben). We meet in his office. This week, I learned that Milton was actually something of a rebel: he was a powerful influence during the English Revolution that lost King Charles I his head, and held office (he was basically the Secretary of State) in Cromwell's protectorate. When the English monarchy regained power, many of Milton's friends were executed for treason. Being an acclaimed poet saved Milton's life. Milton was revolutionary in other ways: he wrote a treatise advocating for divorce and freedom of speech, one or both of which might sound completely normal to you but were about as revolutionary as 1600's England could be.  By the time Milton wrote Paradise Lost, he was completely blind. So far I've only read Book One of the poem, but it's impossible to read all his descriptions about Darkness in Hell and Light in Heaven without wondering what it would be like to live in complete darkness on Earth. On the 22nd line of the poem, Milton calls on God to bless his work: i'm from albany, california, which is a tiny square mile and a half next to berkeley, california. as a result, i say hella... hella. my life goal is to be on extreme couponing: all-stars. my other life goal is to avoid being on hoarders: buried alive. i... read more  see complete archives  You might wonder what possessed me to go to Chicago for the month of January.  The weather forecast for my first day of work. Granted, this factors in the mysterious element of wind chill.  I was graciously accepted by IDEO for the winter, with the stipulation that I would be working at the same office as my MIT sponsor, a Course 2 alumni. I had never been to the Midwest, so I was expecting the Windy City to greet me like this:  Luckily I can say that beyond the weather, Chicago was quite good to me. :)  The snazzy view from my apartment.  Externships are one of the many ways you can spend your IAP. The MIT Externship program is expertly organized by the Alumni Association, which features a bustling community of alums happy to talk about what they majored in, where they lived, and what they're up to these days! It's not surprising that MIT alumni have found homes across the world working on just about anything. MIT alums can work with the Alumni Association to create externship listings that might be a good fit for MIT students (undergrads and graduate) who are interested in the field. The result? A listing of hundreds of mini-internships in dozens of fields, open exclusively to MIT students. Although there is no expectation that you should spend your winter doing a mini-internship, many students throw their hat in the ring because they have nothing to lose! Students can apply to up to three externships in the middle of Fall semester. Every externship listing is differentsome positions require interview(s), while others make their decision based off of a resume and cover letter. Externship matches are announced starting in early November, so you can have a good idea what your IAP might look like by then. Externships are similar to internships in that you meet people in a field you might be interested in, you pick up a few skills, and you hopefully make some contributions to the place you are working at. (For more on getting the most out of an internship, I think this blog post is great!) However, the four week time frame of IAP makes an externship a race against the clockthe pressure is always on to glean as much wisdom and learn as many lessons as possible before returning to campus. I want to share what I learned in my month in Chicago at IDEO, because hopefully you can practice these skills and be much further than I am by the time you are as old and crusty as me:  1. Listen. Ask people to lunch or to coffee and just get to know them! Nobody had a good answer to how they ended up where they are, but everyone was happy to talk about everything they had done up until then. There isn't one path to a goaljust a general movement towards it. The speed and the direction really depends on how you live the rest of your life (and there's nothing wrong with that!) 2. Learn how they learn. Asking someone to teach you something, whether it's big or small, can be overwhelming for both parties! Instead, consider learning how they learn. Ask them what books they read, what blogs they follow, which people they watch, what their favorite videos and podcasts are, and if they can point you to one starting point. Asking many people this question is a quick and easy way to expose yourself to tons of new material. 3. Tell a good story. Everyone I worked with seemed to love to tell a good storywhether it was about last week's trip to Europe or an interaction they had with a client. Good ideas always came in the form of a narrative that was really compelling, not just a recap. 4. Just try it. Maybe not as scary as "just do it", but there was no fear about going down a wrong path. Trying everything helped nix the bad ideas early on!    Actuallythe most important thing I learned? Don't wait.  see complete archives  Nowadays we seem to primarily battle problem sets and thesis snakes, but once upon a time humans did battle with dragons. Right now Im battling a 5.60 (thermodynamics) p-set. The deceptively fluffy roadslush precursor snow from my Gmail background is falling outside my window. I got sick right when I got back to Boston after IAP, so up until a few days ago my personal dragon has been pathetic and droopy and largely sedentary and cold.  My last dragon at MIT was my finals dragon, about two months ago. Because Im a senior all but one of my finals were final projects. My only exam was in 6.034 (artificial intelligence).  Most finals dragons, especially freshman or sophomore year, look more like ginormous hydrae with flamethrowers.  The stick figure warrior is my friend David K. 16. He brought a giant teddy bear friend to all of his finals. If you would like to spread happiness with your every step and dramatically improve the lives of all the people you encounter, bring a giant stuffed animal to your exams. Everyones week was way better than it would have been otherwise.     This is the way I would like to live my life, finals and otherwise. I would be much happier, I think, if I brought a giant teddy bear (or turtle or octopus or cow) to my battles. I think I would fight my battles better if I took them less seriously. In particular, I wish Id had that attitude against the dragon that most of you are facing right now, the dragon that felt like the final boss of my childhood.  There are so many other things I remember from high school. Trying to find a parking spot in Spain. Ice skating with my mom. Skiing in the forest past dark with my family. Learning how to drive with my dad on a two-lane highway, stick shift, farms on either side of us. Eating lunch during chemistry lecture. Staying up late listening to Taylor Swift and burning strawberries into our guitar the night before states. Dreaming about nationals. Crying on the bus home when we didnt make it. Holding hands on the way to class. Falling in and out of love, again and again and again. I dont know why I thought, when I had so many wonderful universes around and within me, that college admissions were more important than all the other experiences I was living. I love MIT, but but there was no good reason for me to want to be anywhere but exactly when and where I already was. When I got deferred, I stayed up all night alone and ate an entire box of clementines. I dont think I did anything unusual between December and March or even between when I got in and when I left for MIT. I wish I had. If I were youwhich is to say, if I could go back in time to four years agoI would try to make those months more special. I have memories of my family going hiking or skiing and me staying home to work. I wouldnt do that. If I could do things over I would work less, kayak more, photograph more sunrises, and try to really get to know the people I loved before all of us changed and split apart. College applications are tiny in comparison to the dragons youve already conquered over the past two decades. At least for me, high school was like the college applications dragon and his dad innocently visiting a Christmas tree farm.  And youve practically already conquered that one. No one, not even MIT, can take away the accomplishments you did or did not list on your college applications or how awesome you are for getting to where you are now. MIT is a pretty cool sword, but its not Excalibur. You wont blind your opponents and youll still bleed. I have a feeling that the scariest dragons that you and I will face in our lives wont be dragons that a college degree could help with, and I am confident that our biggest triumphs or losses will not be an admissions decision. Inhale. Exhale. Bring your teddy bear. You are wonderful. You will be okay. Here are some experiences and advice from other people who were deferred or waitlisted. Lisa Z. 17 The day after I got deferred, my friend took me to the mall to cheer me up, and I remember singing Forget You in the car with her, joking about MIT. It was difficult, because several people in my school applied early action, and two of them were accepted. The rest, like me and one of my good friends, were deferred. When I saw how many people were deferred, I figured it was MITs way of politely denying applicants. I spent the time before final decisions came out absorbed in the application process for other schools, religiously editing essays and looking up acceptance statistics. In the RA round, I wasnt really sure what to write about, so I just gave a paragraph being completely honest about what Id been doing since I sent my application in, and how I felt about each activity. For example, I was musical director the previous year for my schools musical, and I wrote about how I was doing that again my senior year. Then I just gave a funny quote referring to how long waiting for decisions feels. Because I was fairly sure I wasnt going to get accepted, I stopped being super formal in my update form and showed more personality, which actually might have helped. When decisions came out, some of those people in my school were rejected, but they all attend great schools now (Princeton, Yale, Georgetown, etc.). However, some of us, like me and my good friend, were accepted. A deferral definitely does not mean rejection. Ive met so many people here at MIT who were originally deferred. I know that waiting for decisions sucks, but if you keep busy the time will go by much faster. And no matter what, youll end up with some amazing choices for where to attend school for the next four years. Harriet L. 13 I think the first thing I ever received from MIT was my deferral notification, which, though mildly traumatic (This must mean I wont get accepted anywhere), was not surprising, and actually kind of nice, once I realized they hadnt actually rejected me yet, which they would have done if they were sure I wouldnt fit in or survive. My application was nothing special. My essay described daydreaming during my extracurricular activities, which seemed to suggest that I was applying to an art program rather than an institute of technology; the only STEM related activity Id ever done was join the Math Team because they had pretty little puzzles. But I had been honest on my application, told them the truth, as well as I knew it, about myself and my interests; I could expect no more from myself. I gave no updates, for nothing had significantly changed in a few months, and put the application out of my mind and trusted MIT to make a good decision (though actually, Id been almost continuously sick for three months due to applications-related anxiety, and I just didnt want to be sick anymore, and there was no way I was going to let some abstract entity Id never seen before ruin my last chances to do interpretive dances in math class). Anonymous I dont think my deferral experience would be too helpful to others; I was battling personal issues so I did not think about the deferral too much, although I felt pretty deep disappointment when I found out. But I will give a data point: of the five to ten deferred applicants from my school, I was the only one to get in. There were two EA admits, and I dont remember any EA rejections. Ceres L. 14 I actually applied to MIT during regular admission and was waitlisted. Obviously, I was later admitted, much to my surprise. Im now a senior studying Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. To be completely frank, I did not expect to get into MIT. Around my junior year of high school, when I was starting to seriously consider college, MIT was on my list of well, itd be cool but itll never happen colleges. So, when I was waitlisted, I was actually really happy. I took it as some acknowledgement that I was pretty good, and the very fact that MIT told me that they wanted me but did not have enough room at the time was one of the best compliments I had gotten. Of course, I was just expecting to be rejected later, so I didnt think about it much. Long story short, I was admitted in early May. But for you guys who are now waiting for the RA round, Id like to share a bit about my mindset and what I did between regular decisions and waitlist decisions. I sent one update to MIT. I sent them a letter telling them about what I had done in the past few months. And now, I cant even remember what was on it. The letter was just a general status update, telling them about how high school was going, how I was playing in the band for the school play, and how I would love to attend MIT. I didnt beat myself up that I hadnt gotten in RA. I had absolutely no expectations about how the waitlisting round would go. I really guess all I can say to the potential class of 2018 now, is that for those of you who think being deferred is a kick in the face telling you that youre not good enough, dont think that way. There are more people than MIT has room for. There are other colleges that are also really good colleges. MIT is one potential future for some of you, and for the rest, there are others that you may not have even considered yet. Dont think that your achievements arent good enough, or that the things you put on your applications are silly, childish, or whatever other negative things you are thinking about it. In one of my essays to MIT, I compared myself to a sandwich. I was really hungry at the time and wanted a sandwich, so I wrote about it. Do not try to change yourself or paint yourself in a light that you think that MIT would like, because thats not really you. As cruel as this sounds, some of you will not be a good fit for MIT, and if you are able to get in from crafting the perfect application, youll probably end up going to a university that wouldnt benefit you as much as somewhere else. You dont have to just fixate on MIT; there are plenty of opportunities out there. Oh, one last thing. People who get in during early action arent necessarily way better than the rest. You will not be treated differently for not getting in during the early action round, nor is the time at which you were admitted any indication of how successful you will be in the future. Do not fixate only on how you think others will perceive you. In this world, there are always people you need to impress, but the one that is often forgotten and hardest to impress is yourself. James H. 16 When I was deferred, I realized that I had to buckle down, put my nose to the grindstone, saddle up, and whatever other sayings you can think of. It was then that I decided to join the Evil League of Evil to rain down destruction upon humanity. My freeze ray and I would stop the world, and MITs tears would dry when I handed it the keys to a shiny new Australia (a far better place to dump our radioactive waste than Harvard). In all seriousness, upon receiving the letter I watched Doctor Horrible and lazed about. The deferring you received is an invitation to finally finish that freeze ray, pretend to be a statue, and take down Captain Hammer once and for all. To use the words of the thoroughbred of sin himself: There will be blood, it might be yours. So go kill someone. Signed, Bad Horse. But dont actually kill anyone. Obviously.  If you would like some more encouragement and distractions, I wrote you two more blog posts. I wrote them in the past, so you will have to travel: When I woke up this morning, I checked my Facebook (as any good social media addict does) and found these pictures my family posted of around our house in New Jersey:     Oh boy, it looks real bad in NJ.  The blizzard is coming up and hitting the Northeast real hard (Deja vu).  It's a good thing MIT isn't in the Northea...oh wait...              Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh this is the street I cross everyday.The cars slush and turn all the white snow to gray. Ralph Landau looks like a Star Destroyer,while the Green Building teaches future employers. MIT Medical, who helps us when we're sick,Is covered in snow, but only a few inches thick. Media Labbbb, oh Media Laberrhhhhh...uhmmm..it's fab? A snow plow plowing makes it easier for meto get to my class which starts at three. (Thank you MIT faculty that plow the snow for us!) Uhhhh walkway, walkway, and a red thing...its uhhh, getting harder and harder to sing. Close up of the red thing in front of a building that's orange,Oh how I ....no wait NOTHING RHYMES WITH ORANGE :'(  This is getting harder than I thought..What do you think, Stata, should I give it another shot? Underneath the Dome is where I stand,looking far offinto a winter wonderland. And here's your typical pic of the Dome.Still can't believe I can call it my home. Kresge, Kresge, where people love to dance.ssssss..hmmm, ance, ance, uh..uhh.....pants -_-  Uhhh...uhh..I'm out of rhymes again, oh no!This seemed like a good idea twelve pics ago. This field is the last stop before I must goI have three Psets and a quiz tomorrow!   *curtain close* Upon entering MIT, every freshman gets a list of "101 Things To Do Before You Graduate", which varies a slightly by academic year (for example: 2011 and 2008.) On the Class of 2016's list, number 82 tells you to Hack Something, following the proper etiquette (Hacker's Code of Ethics) which is:  And so, walking back to my new dorm Simmons (I just moved, again), I noticed something floating in the air:  It's a hack! The Olympic Rings appeared today over Brigg's field, and upon closer inspection, they were made of plastic tubes hanging from a line connecting the roofs of MacGregor and Simmons. How did they do it?  Woooo Sochi 2014!  If you're interested in previous hacks, MIT hacks have their own lengthy Wikipedia page, in addition to a chronology at hacks.mit.edu.  (pssssst, hey 2016's! We only have 2.5 years to do #82! Let's go let's go let's go)   edit: I recieved an anonymous email with photographs of when the hack was higher up before it was taken down. Was it from a hacker him/herself? ;) Regardless, here are the rings in all their glory!   Dear Pass/No Record*, Im breaking up with you. But dont worry, its not you, its me. Ive moved on. Dont get me wrong though. We had our fun in the fall and Im grateful for the stress relief you provided. The transition from high school to college can be a tricky one, but you were always there for me**. Like a rock. Or that piece of paper I accidentally superglued to my finger once***. I just wanted to let you know that Ive met someone new. Having taken sophomore standing****, Im technically not a freshman anymore, so while most of my fellow freshmen will be on the ABC/no record grading system, I get the pleasure of being acquainted with sophomore exploratory*****. Sometimes even the greatest relationships must come to an end. But lets not dwell on the past. Im with spring semester now****** and next fall, youll meet the wonderful class of 2018******* and welcome them to MIT with open arms. It was nice knowing you. Sincerely,Krystal *: Welcome to the footnotes, the land of comments apparently not important enough to put into the main text. Sometimes though, authors are sneaky and put all the good stuff down here. Its like their way of rewarding thorough readers. I wanted to put tiny, microscopic numbers in the superscript like they do in those fancy publications, but I can't seem to do that here. I had to settle for these floating stars. Anyway, this footnote doesnt actually have any information in it. But the next ones do, so read on my friends. Read on. **: True story. Pass/no record was a great opportunity for me to experiment with my studying habits and general life skills without the stress of worrying about grades. For example, I learned that trying to do an entire pset the night before its due is not the greatest idea, especially if I plan on getting any sleep. Additionally, doing the assigned reading before class helps immensely and eating five cookies in one sitting will most likely lead to a tummy ache. ***: I would not recommend supergluing objects to your fingers. ****: Sophomore standing means, for all intents and purposes, that Im a sophomore starting spring of my first year. Whats the point? 1) I get to declare a major so I am officially course 20 (biological engineering) now and have a new faculty advisor! 2) No more credit limit. Huzzah! For the first semester of freshman year, students are restricted to 54 units (most classes are 12 units, although there are some that are 6 or 9 or 18 units. 1 unit corresponds to approximately 14 hours of work per term) while the spring semester limits students to 57 units. I wanted to take five classes (60 units) so taking sophomore standing allowed me to do that. 3) Sophomore exploratory (see footnote *****) *****: Sophomore exploratory: the magical academic policy that allows students to see their final grade for one designated class before deciding to either keep that grade, or switch to Listener status, which essentially expunges the class from their transcript and forfeits any credits that could have been earned. The deadline for this switch isnt until registration day of the next semester, so theres a fair amount of time to deliberate. Its a policy I hope I will never have to use, but nonetheless, its presence is comforting. ******: Spring semester, I have high hopes for you. Ill be taking 5.12 (organic chemistry), 8.02 (physics II: electricity and magnetism), 18.02 (multivariable calculus), 18.03 (differential equations), and 21f.703 (Spanish 3). Is it weird that I will have less class time during the spring semester than I had over IAP? Taking the EMT training class was an amazing experience and Ive learned so much, but the 9am-6pm hours definitely wont be missed. *******: If you ultimately decide to commit to MIT (hint hint, nudge nudge), know that we are all excited to meet you and that youll have an amazing time here expanding your knowledge, experiencing new things, and meeting some of the coolest people from all around the world.  You: Where are you from?Me: London.You: But you...you don't...you don't seem to have a British accent.Me: Correct. Let me explain! I was born in Singapore, had a Singaporean accent, then moved to London during the summer before fifth... read more  see complete archives  From the MIT Lit dept's Spring 2014 course catalog: - England, 1530s CE: Dissolution of the Monasteries. King Henry VIII gave the word to take over or destroy the nation's monasteries and monastic libraries, leaving us with single digit numbers of books from ancient collections of many hundreds. You're probably wondering how you're expected to sleep for grief, so I'll try to comfort you with a scene from Tom Stoppard's 1993 play Arcadia (which MIT is currently putting on!) *Cleopatra Different fire, different lost texts, but I find the idea comforting all the same. While Henry VIII's crew were burning books, theologians ran around trying to save their ancient texts from destruction. At some point, they opened some of these books and realized that they couldn't read them. This cryptic language was Old English.  Old English was the language of warriors and mercenaries in England between 600 and 1100 CE; our more familiar Germanic-French fusion language took root when William the Conqueror brought the French language across the channel in 1066. To give you more perspective, Shakespeare (Shakespeare) wrote in Modern (well, Early Modern) English. Chaucer wrote in Middle English. Old English resembles modern German more than modern English (it was spoken pre-French influence) and I can guarantee that it would look like complete gibberish to you.  In the spring, I told my Chaucer professor (Arthur Bahr; more on him here and here) that I was eager to learn Old English. In a nutshell, Prof. Bahr said "well, if you find a critical mass of 5+ who quasi-commit to take it, I'll teach it!" So, I found 5+ people who were willing to quasi-commit, and now Prof. Bahr is teaching the course. And 29 - TWENTY NINE - MIT students enrolled in it. (I'd like to casually mention that Old English was offered at Harvard last semester and seven students enrolled.) Prof. Bahr thinks that the class is attractive to MIT students because not only is Old English awesome, it's also extremely challenging, and MIT students tend to gravitate towards challenges. In this class, we're starting from scratch (no prior Old English knowledge required!) and in a single semester will work our way into reading extracts from Beowulf. Right now, we're zipping through the basics of grammar (demonstrative, interrogative pronouns, the past participle, conjunctive adverbs, subordinating conjunctions, prepositionals, predicates...) and case (nominative, accusative, genitive, dative, instrumental) since Old English is (like Latin, and unlike modern English) a case language. We're also zipping through the basics of pronunciation. It's a full-blown, intensive language course.  In case you aren't sufficiently jealous yet, are you a fan of the Lord of the Rings universe? JRR Tolkien studied Old English texts, and the riddles that Bilbo exchanges with Gollum in The Hobbit come from Old English riddle collections. In this class, we're going to read them in Old English. YEAH. When I announced my class schedule on Facebook, a friend commented with "You still take each class from a different department?" More on the rest of my classes later, but I want you to know that it's totally possible to study Lots Of Things at MIT - to be well rounded - and still be successful in your major and your field. I just finished applying and being accepted to grad school, and am now trying to decide where I want to go. I'm continuing with my astronomy research. I consider myself a scientist. But I am also studying Old English with an incredibly dedicated professor, and wouldn't think of taking advantage of MIT's subject offerings any other way.  In a nutshell or two: I'm a budding MechE, love building things, and like to pretend I can do a British accent. I'm a writer, a photographer, a Google ninja, a hipster in denial, a fierce advocate of the Oxford comma. And, of course, a... read more  see complete archives   One of the hardest things to avoid at MIT is a sense of jadedness. After a few semesters of psets, midterms, finals, and projects, that once youthful prefrosh full of joy and excitement can seem a long way away. Ring Premiere, however, is one of those events that brings out the inner prefrosh in all of us. Its the event where the Brass Rat for each class is revealed, and yesterday night the 2016 Brass Rat was revealed! We dont hold to tradition and propriety very much at MIT - the closest thing we have to an official school song is probably the Engineers Drinking Song - but the Brass Rat is one of the few exceptions. From the direction you wear it on your hand, to the many references to punting/tooling/hacking, to the class-specific inside jokes, its cloaked in tradition. Plus, Iron Man wore it.  This years Premiere wasnt without its share of flaws, not dissimilar to the Sochi Olympics, another event suffering ring-related malfunctions and accusations of corruption. There were the usual charges of favoritism leveled at the Ring Committee - of the 11 members, 10 are affiliated to a fraternity or sorority, and only 2 are from the east side of campus.  The RingComm chair is at least the 3rd in a row from the same fraternity, selected behind closed doors. The website malfunctioned for several hours while people tried to figure out where to buy a ring.  And perhaps most ironically for a RingComm made of 5 mechanical engineering majors, they managed to put these seemingly nonfunctional gears on the shank (a metaphor for the grinding mismatched gears of bureaucracy?)  In the end, though, no one will remember these nitpicks. Overdesigned as it is, with sometimes trivial details crammed into every square millimeter, awkward attempts at symbolism (a Newtons cradle hanging from The Alchemists armpits?), and a beaver apparently sporting a black eye - flaws and all, the Brass Rat is quintessentially MIT, and I wouldnt have it any other way. Except for those stupid mismatched gears.    ^ the class shank and seal shank, respectively.  I really like the Curiosity skycrane, MIT Police shield, and reference to last year's massively epic snowball fight:   ^ the hacker's map on the underside of the ring.  I like the nod to Bexley Hall, the dorm that's set to be controversially demolished over the next few years The same day the United States Government furloughed non-essential employees I said my final goodbyes, hopped on a plane to Canada and shipped off to a land of free healthcare, fizzy lemonade and double decker buses.  Patiently waiting to be interrogated and yelled at for misplacing all my papers. My first few weeks at Cambridge flew by. Participating in meets and greets, pub crawls and administrative meetings, it felt like I was a fresher(Freshman) once again. Settling into classes I attempted to fix the one big mistake I made my freshman year by joining tons of societies(clubs). One aspect of University that is often over looked is the fact that there are hundreds of clubs willing to teach you skills that most adults pay hundreds of dollars to pick up. So I went to the society fair, signed up for a dozen more mailing lists than I should have and tried my hand at a few things I wish I'd started at MIT. Dancesport has without a doubt been my largest time sink and my favorite aspect of Cambridge. The club consists of learning and competiting in four styles of dance, Waltz, Quickstep, Cha Cha, and Jive. With lessons and practices spread out over four days of the week, most of my nights end with ONE TWO CHA CHA CHA THREE FOUR CHA CHA CHA.  This is the one society I never saw myself joining. Going to a taster session based on the prodding of a few freshers, I found that I didn't have to live with my two left feet. Going home and watching hours of Dancing With the Stars(Zendaya & Val should've won), I was hooked. Four months and two competitions later, I'm still having a blast. I came to learn how to dance and found a great community of folks who always manage to make me smile.  Team 79 posing after the team matches in Nottingham.  Dancing some Ballroom!  The beginner team posing at the most recent competition in Norwich. Imagine Risk with less complex combat and more intense alliance building/backstabbing and you have a faint idea of what Diplomacy the board game is like. Meeting once a week a group of ~7+ society members sit down, dole out countries and begin the endless game of Diplomacy. Going from year to year Alliances are made (and quickly broken) as each player attempts to gather supply depots. Every other week the society plays various board games (Twilight Imperium, Arkham Horror, Settlers of Catan, etc.) and it's great. A long time D&D/MTG player in HS, it's been nice to get back into the non-digital gaming world. But my one true love has always been PC gaming.   Everyone huddled around as I (as Germany) make my Autumn moves.  El Presidente checking out the situation in Europe.  A Civil War time North America in which the Confederates are holding their ground. A group of gamers who come together to hold termly LAN parties and in house LoL/DOTA2/SC2/etc. tournaments. While they don't meet nearly as often as DipSoc the all day Lan parties have been good fun and as a long time PC gamer it's been a nice return to extended gaming sessions.  Setting up an in-house League game.  A wall of DOTA2 players Tune in next time to learn about how I managed to get locked in the Museum of Chocolate. see complete archives  Earlier today, Kris blogged about financial aid information we need from our early admits and current applicants. Shortly thereafter, we sent an email to these students with this information as well. We use MailChimp to send emails to prospective and admitted students. MailChimp requires that, in the footer to each email, we include a line explaining to the recipient why they received the email, to help them distinguish desired email from spam. The footer to that email, as all emails before it, should have said this:   But what it actually said was this:   Here's what happened: We have two (well, more than two, but only two matter here) lists in MailChimp for any given admissions cycle: a list for admitted students, who receive updates specific to their admitted status, and a list for applicants, who receive updates about the ongoing cycle. All admits are applicants, but not all applicants are admits. Earlier today, I was working with a colleague to clean and consolidate these lists. Cleaning means removing students who have expressed a preference to no longer be emailed by us (by marking messages as spam, by withdrawing their application from MIT, by instructing us that they do not wish to receive email or phone calls from our office, etc). Consolidating means synchronizing the preferences across the two lists so they are both up-to-date.  Usually we do this by deleting and remaking lists. However, this time we tried the recommended MailChimp technique of combining lists. The expected outcome of this approach is that all student accounts in the list are updated to reflect the most recent expressed preference without having to delete and remake lists such that you risk losing important preferential data.  However, there is also an (apparently) undocumented side-effect, which is that combining also imports the footer notice from one list to the other, in this case from the admit list to the applicant list. In other words, it replaced one line, in small print, at the bottom of the email, after we had already (extensively) drafted, reviewed, and approved the text of the email itself. We never even knew. When I was your age I applied to ten colleges. Eight of them were elite liberal arts colleges. Two of them were safety state schools. I would have gone to any of them, but I only wanted to go to one of them. I loved it. I loved everything about it: the campus, the location, the tradition, the people. It as the only place I was really, legitimately excited to go.  One day, in April, I got a thin envelope in the mail from this school. It was addressed to Christine Peterson Fitzpatrick, and it informed me I - or she, or someone - had been denied entry to their school. I called the admissions office, hoping that surely there must have been some mistake. No no, they told me; the letter may have been a mistake, but I was most definitely rejected. And they didn't even apologize for the misprint. I have never forgotten that. I was rejected from seven of those ten schools, but that letter hurt the most, not only because it was my first choice, but because the mistaken identity added insult to injury. It made me feel like they didn't even care. Almost ten years later I know better. I know that the admissions officers at this school care. I know how complex a communications project at this scale can be. It's so easy to make a simple mistake. And yet it still hurts when I think about it. And it crushes - crushes - me to think that I might have unintentionally inflicted something similar on some of you. So, that's what happened. I've fixed the footer in MailChimp. If you are an early admit, you have everything you need. If you are a current applicant - deferred EA, or current RA - you should expect your decision in March, precise date TBD.  My guess is that overall a very small number of our current applicants even noticed this; I didn't even know until someone pointed me to the MITCC thread about it. But any number of people getting this kind of mixed signal is too many. I've been on that side and I know how it feels. And if you've now felt it too, in part because of me, I'm so, so sorry. If you want to talk, post below or send me an email.  You: Where are you from?Me: London.You: But you...you don't...you don't seem to have a British accent.Me: Correct. Let me explain!

We were woken up at 6:30am by very loud, very grand church bells, then couldn't find anything for breakfast because our hostel doesn't serve breakfast on Sundays and apparently neither do any restaurants. We broke our fast with potato chips and a chocolate bar from a grocery store, then rode a taxi to the TeleferiQo. The TeleferiQo is a steep cable car that travels up Volcan (volcano) Pichincha. Quito itself is at just under 10,000 ft (3 km) above sea level, and the TeleferiQo takes passengers on a 2.5 km (~8000 ft) journey to the Cruz Loma lookout point, which is at 13,500 feet (~4 km). From here, people with large lung capacities can hike to the Pichincha volcano summit, which is at just over 15,700 ft (~4.8 km). Feyi joined us for the cable car ride:   We said goodbye to her at the Cruz Loma lookout point, because she had to head back into the city and catch her flight. She's off for a several-month homestay, which I imagine will be an adventure.  The hike began with a very steep ascent, which involved a lot of huffing and puffing and seemed to last forever but gave us beautiful views. We bumped into an awesome old couple from Colorado, who have summitted Cotopaxi (I hope I'm that fit when I'm old!) as well as a European trio with a platter of Swedish, German, and Austrian accents. The German and Autrian girls were lying on their backs, refusing to get up - and the guy from Sweden was promising them chocolate if they would only get up and go up to the summit with him. CL tried to tell them about The Beards - "they play songs exclusively about beards!" - but they didn't really seem to get it. I did make the German girl very excited when I told her that I applied for a scholarship to do research in Heidelberg next year; she said that it's very beautiful and very good for students. Hooray! I felt nauseous and dizzy almost immediately, but the trail flattened out soon enough and my symptoms largely went away. Raphael and I were having cardiovascular difficulties, so we went at a very slow pace and drank lots of water. There were some tricky sections: mud and scrambling and inching on trails flanked by sheer rock on one side and a sheer drop on the other. The views were spectacular, though, and we had a variety of cactus-esque flowering plants for company.     After about two and a half hours, we assessed the situation. We had one very steep, final push to go before reaching the summit; it would take about half an hour. My nausea and dizziness had gone away, but Raphael's had only gotten worse, and he was sitting with his head in his hands. Alarmed, I stopped some French backpackers and asked if they had any headache pills; they seemed even more alarmed at Raphael's symptoms, and advised that we turn around and descend immediately. One of them very kindly gave us a bottle of sugary orange juice, and from then on I had a bizarre craving for Fanta. We left a note for CL, who had sped ahead of us to the summit, and began our descent.  About halfway down, CL caught up with us (that kid is ridiculously quick). The clouds rolled in and it started to rain as our trio approached the TeleferiQo, and right when we got underneath the shelter it started POURING. Somehow, it let up right when we reached the bottom and left the shelter. Success! We shared a cable car with a very sweet non-English-speaking Ecuadorian family and tried very hard to communicate. The two questions that *everyone* here asks us are 1) where we're from and 2) what we think of "my country". As they left the car I logged Embarrassing Spanish Incident #3 by yelling "Hola!" instead of "Adios!" Oh, well.  After some to-do and a heroic sprint by Raphael, we managed to catch a cab back to the hostel. R&R, shower, then a cab back to La Mariscal. After finding almost every restaurant closed, we were forced to eat dinner at Mama Clorinda, a semi-expensive restaurant engineered for tourists. It was filled with Americans and played CNN. Perfect! At least my food was good. I had llapingachos, which are mashed potatoes mixed with cheese and fried. After dinner, we took a cab back to the hostel. Now, journal and sleep =) You: Where are you from?Me: London.You: But you...you don't...you don't seem to have a British accent.Me: Correct. Let me explain!

I don't think I know my Date of Bird? 	- 	My alarm went off at 4am. I submitted my very last application at 2am, couldn't fall asleep until 3am (you know that post-essay adrenaline rush?) and couldn't drag my body out of bed until 4:40. I discovered that the clothes I left out to dry were still SOAKED, and applied the hairdryer treatment with minimal success. Oh well...hopefully there's no mold when I open my suitcase in February. 	Raphael very kindly woke up extra early to help me pack, since I told him that I would be up late. We staggered around packing my things for an hour. I eventually had to give up on ever fitting my laptop into my suitcase; hopefully Eric can fit it into his backpack.  	At 6 or so, we went to the lobby to check out and get a cab to the airport. I was very grumpy, and my grumpiness was exacerbated by the very slow pace at which the rest of the world was moving. After listening to a very involved discussion about perks of hotel membership, we finally stored my bags and took a very sketchy cab ride* to the airport. I made a quick trip to Eric's room to slide the luggage tags under his door. I hope I see my laptop again... 	*Well, Raphael says it was sketchy.

Saleswoman: *point*	Raphael: Merci! 	A for effort! 	Now, we're sitting on the plane from Panama to Quito. Our neighbor here in Row 7 is named Isabel. She lives in Chicago and is visiting her home in Ecuador for the first time in 2 years. She hasn't told her family that she's coming, and is excited to surprise them. We introduced ourselves and she looked delighted: apparently her dad is named Rafael and her mom is named Ana! "Maybe when you have a kid," she said, "you will name her Isabel!!!!" We laughed politely.  	Our names seemed to particularly endear us to her. She wrote down suggestions for how to get to our hostel from the airport (take the trole) as well as for how to deal with taxi drivers trying to rip you off. She invited us to visit her house in the ecological reserve, a 4-hour trip from Quito. She wrote down her phone number and offered to show us around, and said we could call her if anything came up. What a kind person! Definitely intending to take her up on that. 	Woah, we just broke through the clouds. GREEN! Lots of green. Mountains, denser houses than I had imagined. Lots of farmland at the foot of the mountain's peak.   So green. You: Where are you from?Me: London.You: But you...you don't...you don't seem to have a British accent.Me: Correct. Let me explain! I was born in Singapore, had a Singaporean accent, then moved to London during the summer before fifth... read more  see complete archives  I owe you an explanation for my absence (and you'll get WAY more details than you could ever want, don't worry).  To summarize, here's a map:  After my last final on December 20, I flew home to London for winter break. On January 2, I flew to DC for a huge astronomy conference. There, I presented my research as a poster, was judged by various graduate school representatives (some of whom tried to disguise the fact that they were representing graduate schools, some of whom said "you applied to our graduate program! tell me about your research.") and asked Neil deGrasse Tyson a question. On January 10, I packed all my fancy conference clothes and my laptop into a little suitcase and dropped it off at the hotel reception, then slipped the luggage tags under my friend Eric '14's hotel room door. I slung a 60L hiking backpack onto my shoulders and flew to Quito, the capital of Ecuador. Theories about why I was in Ecuador? Study-abroad? Research? Definitely some kind of work, right, since all MIT students go crazy and do lots of work in exotic places during Independent Activities Period? Nope. Believe it or not, I used IAP to go on a three-week vacation, as a celebration of all the stress of senior fall: graduate school applications, fellowship applications, classes, research, dorm government, job interviews. And believe it or not, restoring one's sanity is a totally acceptable use of IAP! I turned my cell phone off, set up an auto-response on my e-mail account saying that I wouldn't be checking it regularly, and peaced out with Raphael (who I met during my internship and who was also at the AAS conference) and Raphael's friend CL.  Here's the sequel map. The red dot in the north is Quito, the city we started and ended in. We first went south, then to the coast, then up the coast, then back to Quito. That spot all the way east is a lodge in the Amazon rainforest: we took a four day Amazon tour before flying out of Quito and returning to school.  Somewhere among all those little black arrows, I climbed to the top of a cathedral's bell tower, hiked the full rim of a caldera (it took ~five hours), went ziplining through a cloud forest, rappelled down waterfalls, fell 40 feet screaming, went horseback riding, rode a lot of buses, learned un poco of Spanish, lay on the beach, stroked a baby caiman, took a lot of malaria pills, and woke up to the sound of a cacophony of howler monkeys. I kept a journal during my travels (I knew that otherwise I would never be able to keep the details straight) so I'm going to transcribe it here and add context, pictures and videos. Brace yourselves! Hi all, Many of you have already filed your application for Financial Aid and thats great! Applications are handled through the Student Financial Services office (SFS). If you have questions, you should use this email: [email protected]/* <![CDATA[ */(function(){try{var s,a,i,j,r,c,l,b=document.getElementsByTagName("script");l=b[b.length-1].previousSibling;a=l.getAttribute('data-cfemail');if(a){s='';r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16);for(j=2;a.length-j;j+=2){c=parseInt(a.substr(j,2),16)^r;s+=String.fromCharCode(c);}s=document.createTextNode(s);l.parentNode.replaceChild(s,l);}}catch(e){}})();/* ]]> */ or call 617-258-8600. Admissions officers wont be answering questions about financial aid on this post because well be in committee making decisions about Regular Action applicants and the comments will be closed. But we did want you to know a few things: You can now track the status of your financial aid application by logging in to MyMIT. Students who have completed their applications by February 15th will receive their financial aid awards shortly after Regular Action admission decisions are made in mid-March. You can still apply for aid after February 15th and it will not hurt your chances of receiving aid, but SFS cannot guarantee that they will have your award processed before May 1st. Applications are read in the order they are completed so the earlier your application is completed, the earlier you will have your financial aid award.  If your family has special circumstances or unusual expenses, or you have other information that will help SFS understand your financial situation more completely, please send a letter detailing that information to: Massachusetts Institute of TechnologyStudent Financial ServicesRoom 11-12077 Massachusetts AvenueCambridge, MA 02139Fax: 617-253-9859 Remember, January through April is peak financial aid application time so please be aware that it can take up to two weeks for the SFS office to receive and process your FAFSA or Profile applications. It can also take up to two weeks to process any documentation received by SFS. Please do not send documents multiple times!

In a nutshell or two: I'm a budding MechE, love building things, and like to pretend I can do a British accent.

These hardcore ice climbers and mountaineers, braving the unknown - it was all very alluring and exotic to me. Growing up in sunny Los Angeles, though, I never got closer to these alpine pursuits than the pages of a Patagonia catalog.  Certainly I loved hiking, and spent a lot of time in national parks like Yosemite and Zion.  But spending time in the outdoors during winter was never something that I really got to do. And so I count myself very fortunate this IAP to have discovered Winter School - an annual winter skills program put on by the MIT Outing Club.  It's been one of the best things that's happened to me at MIT.  These are all silent sports. None requires a motor; none delivers the cheers of a crowd. In each sport, reward comes in the form of hard-won grace and moments of connection between us and nature. - Patagonia, on alpine sports It's easy to get overwhelmed at MIT.  From the pressure cooker of expectations, psets, exams, blah blah blah.  And much has been written about the topic.  People have many ways of dealing with the stress.  For me, winter hiking and climbing are great ways to relieve the pressure.  Because after one too many hours obsessing over an internship or UROP application, it's good to go away for the weekend.  To feel the crunch of snow under the machine-like efficiency of my crampons.  To feel the tension from my body seep out into the refreshing coolness of the alpine air. It's definitely been one of those things where the more I put in, the more I get out.  During Winter School lectures we learned a lot about signs of dehydration, frostbite, and various other dangers - including one particularly nasty slideshow about trenchfoot.  And so here I'll present facts about another serious disease: (1) on Wednesdays at 11:59 am you will invariably be glued to your laptop, frantically refreshing your browser to be the first to sign up for a trip(2) your facebook friends are sick of you posting photos from MITOC hikes and climbs(3) you seriously consider cutting your toothbrush in half to save weight.  Hey, ounces make pounds, and pounds make pain(4) you unironically use the hashtag #funhogging "The simpler you make things, the richer the experience becomes." - Steve House  Just to give you a taste of what Winter School is like, here are some of the photos I've taken over the past few weeks!   ^ ice climbing at Frankenstein Cliffs, NH  ^ snowball assault! good thing my DSLR is weather-sealed.  also, major props to Ben S. on the right for putting together Winter School 2014  ^ post-summit lunches are the best.  ^ view from the trail up Osceola  ^ it was his first time making a snow angel!  ^ practicing self-arresting with an ice axe.  I'm the one closest to the camera  ^ breaking the ice...literally and figuratively  ^ my pack!   See you next January, Winter School. ??.... I kid I kid, though I could write an entire post in Japanese if I wanted to. Maybe I will later, but todays not that day. I just wanted to share this picture (sorry it's blurry, I'll have a better quality one next time I promise):  Its a lake, its frozen. I am standing on it while taking this picture. For a person who grew up in very arid parts of the west coast, I feel like a boss right now.  Sometimes, even during IAP, even after being stuck at home for 6 (yes, for real, thanks mister snow storm) extra days than intended before coming back to campus, I forget that theres a world outside the MIT bubble. Sounds crazy, right? Well, do you want to leave home when you have so much fun with the people in your family and feel comfortable there? The answer to that is usually no, especially when your home is a college campus where events and famous people will often come to you. The reason Im off campus is actually for a class thats part of GEL  Project Engineering. So you have to wonder, why did they bring us out to New Hampshire to do this? Wouldnt it have been a lot warmer and more convenient in a classroom on campus? Well sometimes I have to leave where I spend most of my time, take a deep breath, look up at the stars and tell myself that everythings going to be alright. How the class itself goes will be another story, but I do like looking up at a clear night sky away from the city. You can say thats cheesy, and that I didnt actually answer the question, but hey, I feel what I feel. Also electric blankets: if you dont have one, you should get one. Its pretty awesome.  IAP is a wonderful time here at MIT, where the month of January is transformed into a mix of adventures, innovation, and learning.  I am spending my IAP with my head in the books, trying to absorb as much information as I can in my training to become an EMT.  Here are some of my friends' descriptions of their IAPs in their own words.   - - - Dalia L. '16 - Mechanical Engineering When I was a freshman, I filled up my IAP with so many activities that it became legitimately stressful. This year, as a sophomore in mechanical engineering, I made a point to have a more relaxing IAP while still doing activities that interest me. I decided to spend the first three weeks of IAP at MIT, and the last week at home. Over the past few weeks Ive been doing a bit of this and a bit of thatlike Michael C. 16, I did both 2.670 and UPOP (my UPOP table had the best team spirit!). Ive also been teaching Hebrew! MIT has a great culture of sharing and teaching, and its especially prevalent over IAP. I teach Hebrew for fun and as a way to give back to the community. Last year I helped out Inbar Y. 15 with teaching the class, but this year Ive been on my own. MIT Hillel sponsors the class, but its open to anyone in the MIT community and is especially useful for anyone planning on doing MISTI Israel. In one of the recent classes we watched Ushpizin, a great Israeli movie. And one of my students went out and bought Israeli snack food, so we even had delicious snacks to go along with our movie. Afterwards... well, afterwards I gave them a vocabulary quiz. (Im not a mean teacher, though!) And thats my IAP in a nutshell!   Hebrew students hard at work on their vocab quizzes! Photo taken by Dalia L. '16.   Marvin R. '16 - Electrical Engineering and Computer Science I'm doing two activities for this IAP. The first of which is a swim class, so I can finally get the swim requirement out of the way. The other is being one of the two chairs for Bad Ideas. The swim class has proven to be fun. I'm able to float and swim on my back now, so that's great! Though I have to work a little more on swimming on my stomach, I'm getting there. I won't have to worry about swimming later now! This year marks the 12th year of Bad Ideas. Bad Ideas is an annual event held towards the end of IAP each year. This year it'll be the 24th-26th of January, happening now. It's a weekend where students can come and relax and enjoy some of the more questionable activities that people have concocted. There are annual traditions that happen such as the Wings Eating competition (kicks off Bad Ideas) and the Green Building Challenge (run up and down the Green Building as many times as you can). But there are also events that people propose that are brand new. Some of this year's proposals include Quadcopter Target Practice, Smoothie Roulette, and Wife Carrying! There are many more events that'll happen, too! I really like being Bad Ideas chair. It can be a little stressful, but it does seem like it'll pay off. My favorite moment so far was when my co-chair (Michael E. 2015) and I bought 60 feet of sausage. The store didn't actually believe that we were serious! It was a pretty magical place. My best advice? If you're taking swim during IAP and you can afford to do so, stay indoors until you completely dry off.  Marvin and I organized the Green Building Challenge together! Here we are at the top of the Green Building stairs waiting to serve the champions Gatorade.   Emma S. '16 - Mechanical Engineering A majority of my time this IAP was spent in lab at my UROP. I work at the Computational Fabrication Group in CSAIL designing and fabricating mechanical assemblies using 3D printing technologies. As a mechanical engineer in a computer science lab, I'm relied on heavily for my fabrication abilities. SIGGRAPH, the biggest output for all the research done in the Computational Fabrication Group, has paper submissions due midway through January every year. The opportunity to submit to SIGGRAPH only comes once a year, so the time leading up to it is quite hectic. Everyone in the lab was working hard all month in hopes of submitting a paper that would potentially be accepted at SIGGRAPH. The SIGGRAPH deadline made me a 'ghost'. I essentially lived in my lab, coming home to my dorm at 5 o'clock in the morning a couple of times. The day before the deadline I didn't even go home, and was in lab for 29 hours straight! Now this sounds like my IAP was quite miserable, but in all reality I have had a great time. All those late nights working were a personal choice, and I was in no way obligated to work that much. I ended up joining a lot of different projects in the lab that needed my help, and as a result will be an author in numerous papers! A long with UROPing all the time, I also participated in MITOC winter school. I've always loved the outdoors, but never really did any winter hiking before. Winter school provided me with the amazing opportunity to learn winter survival skills, and the ability to go on trips every weekend. So far I've gone on a trip every weekend this IAP. Last weekend I summited the Wildcat mountains in New Hampshire and learned how to ice climb! It was a lot of fun, and I'm excited for my trip this weekend. My friend Michael C. '16 and I are finally going on a trip together, and we'll be camping and hiking above tree line. Michael C. '16 wrote a really great post about winter school that describes a lot more about it, and I highly recommend reading it. Hopefully he'll write a post about our epic trip this weekend. Next week I'll be participating in UPOP, and I also took a Top Roping PE class. All in all, my IAP has been a lot of fun. To anyone considering UROPing all IAP, I say go for it! You don't have to put in as much time as I did, and you can even get paid for your work! I'm really lucky in that I get paid to have fun and learn, and I think the UROP program provides an amazing opportunity. I've learned a lot about my limits in terms of work and outdoors ability, and really you can do anything you set your mind to! Emma's pictures from Winter School:      Vicki C. '16 - Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Over IAP, I'm trying to get out of debt. I'm working full time in a robotics lab at UMass Lowell; I'm working to port some old code for an automated wheelchair into the standard system that the rest of my lab uses. Over the past week I learned a ton about build systems, which take many different files of code and link them together. I'm also working full time in the STEP Lab on campus here, where I'm helping to design edX class modules about videogames and education. Additionally, I'm working part time doing web development for a small business owner in California! I've never used Django before, and there's definitely a bit of a learning curve. I'm taking a robotics class, 6.270, where you build and automate a lego robot to complete a task. The competition this year involves collecting rings and placing them onto the two towers in the center of the field. My team is all girls, so we're going to get an Arwen lego figurine to stand at the head of our robot (She's the ONLY female lego minifig from LotR!). Lastly I have odds and ends: I'm volunteering with the local Girl Scouts, and am working with girls doing their Gold Award projects. I'm learning to ice skate for PE credit (I'm from Texas....I never got to learn as a kid!). And even though there's snow on the ground here, I'm starting to apply for summer jobs. I really enjoy each of the things that I'm doing, but I wish that I had more time (and brainpower) to spend on each of them. That being said, I'm really heavily weighting my work hours into IAP for a reason. I've learned in the past that it's not realistic to work more than twenty-five hours in addition to taking classes during the semester. I miss sleep a lot now, but at least it means that my grades won't suffer for it over term, AND I can still afford to eat!   Valentina C. '16 - Mechanical Engineering Three things: UROP, poetry, and a wedding. After convincing my parents of the academic value of being at MIT over IAP, I left warm Miami for blizzard blown Cambridge; strange choice maybe, but I wasnt lying about the academic value. For 20 days I worked hard at my UROP with the Little Devices Lab at MIT on a new project involving diagnostics. Not only did I get more done then I ever thought I could, but I taught myself a few new skills which had been on my to-do list since getting to MIT. Its a pretty good way to start off the New Year. However, its not just hard work all the time. IAP though a great opportunity to learn and work is also a perfect time to give a little love to interests that may be a bit neglected during semester. This IAP Ive pushed myself to write more poetry and though most of them arent quite ready yet, its a good start. I mentioned above working for 20 days and this is because I only spent 20 days in Cambridge; I spent the rest of IAP in Nicaragua, which is where my family is from. Its not the most urban of countries but it has some of the most beautiful natural landscapes. Just from the plane you can see crater lakes left behind by volcanoes and luscious forests. Its been almost 2 years since I last visited which is also how long its been since Ive seen most of my familyits about time. My first cousin is getting married and shes one of the more exciting characters in my family (already an energetic bunch to begin with) so the wedding is sure to be a hoot! As much as I love MIT, so much as to beg my parents to send me there prior to our trip to Nicaragua, its also important to take breaks which is why Im grateful to be able to spend a couple weeks before semesters rolls around again relaxing, being with family, and sleeping... a lot.    Lauren S. '16 - Mechanical Engineering During IAP, I am taking a class on programming in Python. It's a lot of work but really useful, plus it'll make next semester's classes easier. I am learning a lot of useful fundamental skills that apply to many languages, as well as syntax/practices unique to Python. My advice for people who want to take classes during their IAP is to make sure you check out the IAP listings as soon as they get posted and make a note of all the lottery deadlines. I missed almost all of the lotteries last year, so I didn't get into most of the classes I wanted and ended up having a fairly boring IAP. This semester, I was also able to get back into taekwondo after a short hiatus during fall semester, work on a few personal projects that got neglected during term, hang out with friends at other Boston colleges who I don't get to see too often, and sleep aggressively. IAP is the best time of year! I am so excited for Bad Ideas.   - - - As you can tell, my friends are having a lot of really great experiences during IAP, and it varies even more from theirs. There are people doing externships in other states and countries or saving the world doing volunteer work on campus or off campus.  There are so many opportunities for people during IAP at or through MIT, and as Valentina C. '16 told me, MIT students shouldn't let their parents or other people guilt them out of having a great IAP. IAP is not a real break - it is a time to take advantage of the opportunities at MIT that you normally would not get to do during the semester. So our advice to you is to spend your IAP having fun or taking an awesome class.  It is completely worth it.   On a final note, someone came home for IAP.  DERP CAT IS BACK!!             El ano pasado, yo tome algunos clases durante de IAP como una introduccion a Python y una practica de teatro por trabajar en la produccion Margo Veil. Pero en Diciembre, decidi que este IAP yo debo usar el tiempo para recuperarme del semestre pasado y disfrutarme con mis amigos en la comunidad de MIT. Por eso, aunque mis amigos y yo estamos involucradas en muchas actividades (por ejemplo, 6,270 [una competicion de robots construido de LEGOs], practicando la esgrima, representando en una obra de teatro, haciendo un UROP o un trabajo corto, trabajando en Battlecode, o tomando clases), nosotros tenemos tiempo para divertirnos. Usualmente, algunas personas estan jugando videojuegos competitivos en nuestra sala. La semana pasada, los favoritos fueron Mario Kart Wii y Super Smash Brothers Brawl (no se las traducciones). Ademas, porque hay alrededor de once o doce personas en la sala cada noche, nosotros pudimos jugar Mafia. Para los lectores quienes no conocen el juego, es una batalla entre ciudadanos y mafiosos. Hay un dios que esta narrando el juego y durante la fase nocturna del juego, la Mafia elige un inocente para matarlo. Durante la fase diurna, todos los jugadores debaten la identidad de los mafiosos y votan para matar al mayor sospechoso. Si los ciudadanos matarian a todos los mafiosos, los ciudadanos ganarian y viceversa.  Aparte de muchos juegos y peliculas, no hicimos alguna cosa interesantisima. Pero yo puedo compartir unos cuentos cortos y chistosos: Anteayer, alguien regreso de la cena con un CD que un estudiante de Harvard le dio en el metro. El artista se llama sombra cisne negra (Shadow Black Swan) y el album de musica se llama Un Brindis Amargo a mi Mas Interno (A Bitter Toast to my Inner Most). Pues... es muy extrano. El otro dia, alguien envio un correo electronico a un creador de Soylent, una comida liquida que contiene todos los nutrientes que una necesitaria en un dia. Mi amigo escribio que nosotros somos un grupo de estudiantes del MIT y quisimos probar su producto. Por el Soylent, nosotros le vamos a crear unos blogs de video a cambio para hacer la critica de su producto. Por el momento, no recibimos una respuesta pero ojala que el respondiera. A veces, nosotros vemos la tele. Un cosa nosotros hemos vieron es La Belleza y El Geek. Es un programa que presenta a muchas parejas de una belleza y un geek. Cada pareja tiene que trabajar juntos para completar o ganar competiciones. Si una pareja ganaria, ellos obtendrian 100,000 dolares australianos. Aunque muchas de las personalidades son falsas, es muy divertido burlar de los actores. Por ultimo, mi amigo que trabaja por Twitter en San Francisco y unos amigos aqui estamos filmando unos blogs de video para compartir nuestros vidas y ser creativos. Cada persona hizo mas o menos tres videos hasta hoy, pero filmaremos mas en el futuro.

.-.-.- Il y avais cinq mois depuis que je me suis promis, apres HackMIT, a finir toutes les classes sur Codecademy avant l'automne de 2014. Et voila:  Ouai, c'est vrai. J'ai officiellement fini la premiere classe, la classe de Python, sur Codecademy. Yaaay! Mais maintenant, je ne suis pas sur quelle langue je veux apprendre suivant. Il y a trop de choix: peut-etre je vais creer un site web et apprendre HTML et CSS, ou je peux concevoir un jeu video avec JavaScript. Je ne sais pas. Que pensez-vous? Laissez une commentaire et dites-moi quelle classe est la meilleure ou la plus utilisee.Sur le sujet de "hackathons," je dois dire encore: c'est une vrai source d'inspiration et une experience on doit avoir. Si vous etes en lycee, j'ai l'opportunite parfaite pour vous: les organisateurs de HackMIT sont en train de preparer pour un hackathon specialement pour les eleves du secondaire, le 22 fevrier, qui s'appelle "Blueprint."  Peut-etre je vous verrais la! --------------------------------------- Mais en ce moment, je reste en Maryland, 1.5 semaines restantes pour mon stage etudiant. Jeudi dernier, toutes les etudiantes MIT ont eu un grand tour de Goddard. On a vu toutes les salles blanches, notamment la plus grande salle blanche du monde, dans laquelle le telescope spatial James-Webb (JWST) s'assemble. JWST va succeder le telescope spatial Hubble, et il va observer dans l'infrarouge pour examiner les premieres etoiles et galaxies dans l'univers. C'est un projet incroyable, parce que le miroir primaire est trois fois plus grand que lequel de Hubble, et il est segmente en 18 elements hexagonaux en beryllium pour etre leger et compact. Et donc, j'ai pris un "selfie" dans le miroir fabrique specialement en beryllium, parce que quand autre peux-je obtenir un photo comme ca?  On peut voir le "Webb-cam" en direct de la salle blanche ici: c'est tres cool. Les instruments la seront dans l'espace en quatre ou cinq annees! --------------------------------------- Je continue, pendant ce temps, a faire le diner tout seul. C'est une veritable aventure, mais j'ai beaucoup de chance et j'avais eu de nombres succes. Voyez les photos ci-dessous, et me disez ce que vous pensez!       Et un photo plus, juste parce que Goddard, c'est vraiment un beau campus:  Amities, Allan = !    = , .  == =,    =       .   =  =      =       , =   =     ,     . =  .   = , =  =     =   ==    =.       =,    . =   , =    .   =  = =       , =    .   ,   =   .        =  ,       .  =    ,   ,  .       = ,   =, .       =?  = =    ==    . = ,  = ,   , .  = == =    , =, =,   (  =). =? .       !              ,  =       . =      =  =  =    =.       =,     =          ==  .       ==    =  =  == = =     =.      , =        ==  . =    =  .         !       Bonjour, blogosphere! Ca fait longtemps que jai ecrit un post. En toute honnetete, il y avait beaucoup de choses et des evenements qui se sont passes le dernier semestre, mais je n'ecrivais rien. En ce temps-la, je pensais que tout etait ennuyeux. Cependant, apres avoir pense plus, je crois que quelque choses formidables se sont vraiment passes, et jespere a ecrire plus de posts sur le blog pour les expliquer. Maintenant, revenons a nos moutons. Je veux ecrire un peu au sujet du dernier week-end. Cest la meilleure preuve que ma vie nest pas seulement pour mes classes et mes devoirs. Malheureusement, je ne peux pas ecrire pour longtemps, parce que je dois finir les ateliers pour une conference psychiatrique au sujet de la sante mentale. (Je moccupais de la logistique de la conference depuis deux mois, et je parlerai de lhabilitation des etudiants qui deviendront chefs  pas de chefs culinaires, bien sur !  et comment on peut collaborer avec les administrateurs aux universites. Mais, encore, je digresse  le dernier week-end.) Vendredi, je suis alle a Providence pour rendre visite a quelques amis. Apres etre arrive, jai rencontre Andrew, qui travaille a Sproutel, a son bureau. La, les employes font les nounours (qui s'appellent Jerry) qui enseignent les enfants diabetiques a gerer leur maladie. Les enfants surveillent la glycemie de leur nounours et lui donnent de la  nourriture.  Par consequent, les enfants qui soccupent des nounours apprennent comment on vit avec le diabete. Sproutel est presente sur Upworthy, et quand je parlais avec Andrew vendredi, jai appris que Sproutel est assez celebre, donc ce nest pas etonnant que les trois employes de Sproutel soient assez confortables avec la presse. Prochain, jai rencontre Julia, une amie et une etudiante a Brown University, pour diner. Nous avons mange au restaurant et raconte nos nouvelles  cetait tres sympa. Moi, jai mange du saumon et de la puree, mais je n'ai pas pris de photo, parce que je ne suis pas comme une hippie sur Instagram. Pendant notre repas, elle ma demande,  A ton avis, qui est l'aspect le plus important de tes etudes a MIT?  Dabord, je suis devenu un peu triste : il ny a que six mois avant que j'obtienne mon licence, et le temps qui reste passe trop vite! Ensuite, je lai dit : laspect le plus important de mes etudes, cest determination, ou la puissance de changer votre cap sans probleme. Apres tout, MIT est difficile, donc il faut preparer bien et etre pret pour n'importe quoi, meme les choses enormes. Cependant, je mentirais si je vous disais que jai appris tout que cette lecon peut me dire. De temps en temps, je cherche les emplois pour gagner de largent apres mes etudes, mais cetait difficile a faire. Cest un peu etrange. Je ne peux pas choisir entre mon travail au labo et des emplois dans le domaine de la sante publique. Quelques amis dAndrew me suggerent de ne pas travailler seulement pour largent, meme si je veux retourner a lecole apres une annee sabbatique. Je ne suis pas sur que je sois daccord avec ca, mais mes conversations avec les amis dAndrew me laissaient inspire. Ils sont tous entrepreneurs, y compris deux femmes qui ont dessine des montres classe pour les aveugles. Une autre amie que jai rencontree samedi veut commencer une maison de quartier en New York avec les jeux de societe. Il meme semble que MIT encourage lesprit dentreprise ; donc, bien sur, il semble naturel detre innovateur, ou au moins, courageux...mais comment? Quelquefois, trouver votre destin est impossible! Il y a trop de choix, mais il ny a pas assez de temps pour choisir. He matriculado en cinco cursos, incluyendo espanol 3, para el proximo semestre y estoy muy emocionada. La calidad de mi espanol sera mejor dentro de nada. Pues, espero que si. De todos modos, yo vivo en el dormitorio Maseeh (el mejor dormitorio del campus, por supuesto), un castillo con siete pisos llenado de estudiantes impresionantes. La diversidad del alumnado es algo muy especial. Este fin de semana, anduve por los pasillos de Maseeh en busqueda de algunos amigos y sus opiniones. Les ofreci galletas a cambio de un parrafo corto sobre MIT, IAP, el universo, y todo. Galletas son la nueva moneda del mundo. Yo siempre estoy discutiendo mis pensamientos y mis experiencias. Que monotono. Ahora, vamos a escuchar (leer) las voces de Maseeh. Sin mas preambulos:                                                                      .                                       - Malek '17  - Willow '17 MIT est vraiment une universite formidable qui cherit le creativite et l'imagination de ses eleves. Le mois de IAP est un tres bon exemple de ca! Pendant ce mois, les eleves peuvent prendre des classes de langues informatiques a vannerie sous l'eau! Aussi, on a beaucoup de temps libre pour poursuivre des activites uniques et interessant. Par example, mes amis et moi, nous sommes voyager a New York pour un weekend. Ce petit vacance etait plein de surprises et rire. Les lumieres a Times Square etaient stupefiant et la nourriture formidable! Des quon est arriver, il a commence a pleuvoir mais malgre ca, on a marche toute la journee en cherchant la statue de la liberte et Wall Street. On a rencontre beaucoup de personage interessant comme un home qui nous a donne des embraces gratuit au milieu dun marche en plein air. Maintenant, on prend des classes de python, java et de dance hip hop et on travaille sur des UROP. IAP est un temps de repos et detente mais aussi daventure et jai hate dexperiencer le reste de IAP! - Rita '17  - Ian '15 The following takes place between 4PM and 5PM in the hemispheres of a cranky blogger. 	  	! =[w 63- ;355[4t[rs 5/][ t0[ /ss[rt934 t0/t t0[ t[;049;/6 s9][ 3= })T w/s4t [94- r[2r[s[4t[] w[66 [43u-0. !s / =3r5 3= s35[t094-r[t/69/t934? ;3u4t[r-5[/sur[? 5[t/-;3u4t[r-5[/sur[?) /5 -394- t3 63- /3ut / s2[;9=9; /s2[;t 3= )!<. :3, 43t / t[;049;/6 /s2[;t 3= )!<.

Hi all- Im taking a break from reading applications to give our Regular Action applicants a quick update. As of today, we have finished processing all mail and loaded everything into our system. If you have applied to us Regular Action, please log into MyMIT and confirm your application tracking is complete. We just emailed everyone who is missing one or more components so you may have received a direct message from us. If you have missing components, dont panic. We have not yet begun to review partial applications, and we never make admissions decisions unless we have enough information to make an informed decision.  All missing components must be received by: Tuesday, January 28, 5pm Eastern Time  Please ONLY FAX to:1-617-687-9184 And here's some other important info: Back to reading now!  Happy Friday! It's now about halfway through IAP, Independent Activities Period, Period of Independence and Activity-Doing! I've lived here in Maryland for about two weeks now, all by myself, working this NASA internship, and I must say it's been quite an adventure. I've settled into a schedule here, working a nine-to-five job, and learning a lot--I definitely know a lot more about stepper motors, C, and MATLAB than I did two weeks ago. It's awesome. Nevertheless, you do get a little bored living by yourself, so I decided to try out something new tonight while making dinner. And that was to film it. On video. And put it on the internet. Whether that means that I'm very shameless or just very stupid remains to be seen. Maybe I need more people to talk to. In any case, that video is now online and below for your general reference and watching amusement, because I basically have zero kitchen skills whatsoever. I also have no video editing software whatsoever and filmed this on a handheld cell phone, so I apologize in advance for any bad videography/sound quality/general sloppiness. It's my first time. Please don't judge me too hard? :) --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- Here's the final dinner sitting in front of me right now! And trust me, it's delicious. Maybe more so because cooking dinner myself makes me about ten times hungrier.  --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- And here are some links to things I mentioned in the video! All about the James Webb Space Telescope, the successor to Hubble Dryden Flight Research Center being renamed after Neil Armstrong Concurrent Engineering and the Instrument Design Lab The Gym Workout Routine Without A Gym (from r/bodyweightfitness) --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- Definitely let me know what you guys thought about the video. Good? Bad? Positively horrible? Waaaaay too long? (I feel you--I definitely got a little carried away there. Time flies when you're talking to a camera, I guess.) Should I do it again? You decide! And if you have any cooking tips/suggestions/lifehacks/ways-to-not-be-clueless-in-a-kitchen, leave those below in the comments and I'd be eternally grateful :) Yours, Allan In a nutshell or two: I'm a budding MechE, love building things, and like to pretend I can do a British accent. I'm a writer, a photographer, a Google ninja, a hipster in denial, a fierce advocate of the Oxford comma. And, of course, a... read more  see complete archives  *in the solid phase  This is a recipe for The Best Tasting BLT Sandwich In The WorldTM: (1) Slap together week-old bacon, lettuce, tomatoes, bread.(2) Forget to add mayo.(3) Hike 10 miles through snow, over ice, and across rivers with the MIT Outing Club (MITOC)(4) Eat BLT. The point is, of course, that the longer youre away from something the more you appreciate it. True for food, true for MIT. Because as good as it was to be home in December for winter break (back home, winter is 70 degrees), after a week or so I found myself missing the little things about MIT. The bipolar weather. The strange architecture. The random middle-of-the-night conversations about quantum dots and social media strategies. The soggy burritos from Annas. Its good to be back. Anyways, its IAP (Independent Activities Period), the month where we can do whatever we want (be that classes, working on personal projects, or just chillaxing), and heres what Ive been up to:    A class!  But not your average lecture class.  2.670 is essentially a shop training class for mechanical engineers - you learn the basics of using a mill, lathe, bandsaw, etc.  Even if you already have these skills I recommend taking the class - it'll give you universal shop access to many shops on campus (including the Edgerton Center, where getting off the waiting list can take months), and it'll get you acquainted with the Pappalardo shop staff, who you'll be working closely with in 2.007 (the robot competition class) and 2.009 (the super duper awesome capstone senior product design class). Plus, you get to machine your own flashlight out of aluminium!     More school!  But again, not your typical MIT class.  Run by MITOC, Winter School does have weekly lectures, but they're about teaching outdoor winter survival skills.  And this being MIT, we like to put a nerdy spin on things. During a lesson on food and water, the 3.091 TA teaching the lecture calculated the integral for heat required to melt snow, using the latent heat and heat capacity of water.  Other lecture topics: how to ice climb, how to snowshoe, and how to pee when the snow is 4 feet deep. The lectures are only a small part of what Winter School is about, though - it's really all about the weekend trips.  Usually there'll be a dozen or so trips per weekend in New Hampshire, letting you apply the winter skills you've learned in lecture.  Yay for Mens et manus!  Overheard on my first Winter School trip: "Crampons make me feel like I have ice-walking superpowers!" So far I've done a hike up Mt. Jackson; this week I'm hiking up Mt. Moriah and Mt. Surprise on Sunday, staying at a MITOC cabin overnight, and then ice climbing in New Hampshire's Frankenstein Cliffs.   Big shoutout to my first trip leaders Carolin and Wolfram, who kept the conversation lively and discussed important topics like how to walk in crampons ("walk as if you were a cowboy, like you have massive balls between your legs), German hiking traditions, and how to color match a Patagonia jacket with an Arc'Teryx backpack.  The really great thing about MITOC is how open and accessible it is.  Normally winter gear costs a fortune; buying a backpack, crampons, mountaineering boots, ice axe, and ice pick could easily run you over a thousand bucks.  That's not including the cost of getting trained to use that gear; getting an ice climbing lesson from a local climbing gym can cost several hundred dollars alone.   But a MITOC membership is only around $20, and you can go on as many trips as you'd like for nominal fees (usually the biggest cost is paying your driver for gas - generally around $20).  And after paying a deposit you can rent gear for very reasonable rates (usually around $5).   MIT is good at teaching technical skills.  There's a reason it produces some of the best engineers in the world. Where an MIT education can fall short, however, is in "soft skills" - things like team dynamics, negotiation tactics, and leadership strategies.  That's where UPOP (Undergraduate Practice Opportunities Program) steps in.  It's a week-long "boot camp" during IAP where you do a lot of workshops on developing these skills, and get broken up into teams that give presentations at the end of the week. UPOP isn't perfect - sometimes the sheer volume of workshops and presentations was difficult to absorb - but on the whole I found it a valuable experience that I think helped fill some of the gaps in my MIT education.  For MechEs especially, those team management skills will come in handy in project classes like 2.009.  My UPOP team, Team Two Tau. On the right is Kate T. '16, who's also going ice climbing with me on Monday.  Yay for Winter School/UPOP crossovers!  [photo creds for this to Sophia L.

Being part of the MAS Freshman program, I spend a lot of time there. It's a research facility that specializes in projects that focus on interfaces, interactions, and communication between man and machine. And it looks like the USS Enterprise merged with the Men In Black Headquarters, except without aliens (for now). Normally, I would be there for my Fundamentals of Computational Media Design class (MAS.110) or for just getting "lost" in the many halls of the labs, looking at every project I can find. But today, I was there to attend the final presentation of the class Science Fiction to Science Fabrication (MAS.S65). In the classs, grad students would be exposed to various science fiction books and then create a final project based off an idea from any science fiction story they so wish (Hopefully no one ever makes Soylent Green). I took my seat as the presentation started. I looked around the room to see who was presenting first. This caught my attention.  Good enough view? Not for me either. So I got a closer one.  Its a robot arm. A robot arm! As in, not a human arm, but a robot arm. Like, remember that time Luke Skywalker got his arm chopped off by Darth Vader in Episode V? He replaced it with a robot arm. And guess what. This is a robot arm! It's a match! Just add tan spray paint. Ok, so maybe I'm getting a little overexcited, but I think that's the point. I know robot arms aren't the newest thing around but I've never seen one in person before and here was a project by student Guillermo Bernal where he nonchalantly made his robot arm mimic basic gestures triggered by bio-signals sent from his actual arm.   After my excitement calmed, down, the next project was up. This one was based off of the 1963 novel Cat's Cradle, by Kurt Vonnegut. It involves a polymorph of water known as Ice-9. When it comes in contact with water below 45.8 C, it acts as a seed crystal and freezes the entire body of water. Curious with the idea of Ice-9, Ermal Dreshaj and Sang-won Leigh began looking for a substance with similar properties and found sodium acetate, a food-grade compound that would stay a liquid at room temperature until it was agitated, thus solidifying the liquid. Using Rhinoceros 3D, they made molds of tools that could fit into glasses. Just imagine James Bond at a cocktail party, waiting for just the right moment to drop some sodium acetate into his drink to make any tool needs and then re-liquefy it to use again later. Not shaken nor stirred.   The projects kept on coming. Alexis Hope, Felix Heibeck, and Julie Legault presented "Sensory Fiction", which uses lights, sounds, sensors, and even a wearable to create an "immersive reading experience". The wearable gets hotter and the lights get brighter if the main character was at, say, a beach. It could also vibrate in a pattern similar to a heartbeat to simulate the character's heartbeat in the story during intense or relaxing scenes. Just like those 4D movies where the chairs move and wind is blown in your face. Except this is with reading.   Another project was a visual representation of the MIT Media Lab (Building E-14) by Paloma Gonzalez. Kinects had been set up throughout the Media Lab to track movement. The data was collected onto a diagram map that reveals the most commonly taken paths and the areas where people stand the most, along with creating an awesome visual that puts Windows screen savers to shame. Using this data reveals how people move about inside a building and can potentially influence and optimize future floor plans and architectural designs. Epic picture. Epic name. Epic movie idea.   One of my favorite projects came from someone in the audience. I'm not sure of the details but I knew that she wanted to attend the presentation but she couldn't because was currently in London. Yet she attended anyway. In this. ...this. I want to build this. I need an iPad, FaceTime, a remote controller, and a Segway. Hopefully I'm not drastically oversimplifying it.   Awesome presentations, awesome ideas, and a final thank you to Dan Novy and Sophia Brueckner, the two MIT Media Lab researchers that taught the class and showed the importance of science fiction in engineering the future. The full list of projects can be found at scifi2scifab.media.mit.edu. Another great read is Why Today's Inventors Need to Read More Science Fiction, which is about this class and discusses the notion that science fiction is meant to show us what can go wrong so we can fix mistakes before we make them.

Scene: Monday night in a green boarding house. Poetry books, cookie crumbs, and light are scattered across the dining room tables. There is a lively murmur and a beat in the background. IAP is one week in. I spent the weekend drawing, cutting, and gluing together my first project for a month-long intensive Introduction to Architecture and Environmental Design class, taking a break to walk along the Charles with a new-ish friend, have dinner with an older one, and attend the latest iteration of the Wandering Cricket Night Market after a thunderstorm. Now, after dozens of hours in the architecture studio and a full day of presentations and review, I'm deciding to be at home. I'm taking stock of the semester that passed. In the beginning, it was like a full-blown middle-school crush. I had a giant crush on MIT. I signed up for a million classes (five and a half, actually, or 66 units, which number turns out to feel like a million to me) and I loved them all and walked around feeling fireworks all the time. I moved to pika, and with Michael Waldrep, a masters student in the Department of Urban Studies and Planning, made this. In This Building: 69 Chestnut Street, or pika from MIT CoLab on Vimeo. Video by Michael Waldrep. October and September: I took weekends away. I camped in New Hampshire with MIT Outing Club, listened to bluegrass at the FreshGrass festival Mass MoCA, toured the rocky outcrops of western Massachusetts and upstate New York with my geology class, 12.001, and went to Maine with forty-something urban planners-in-the-making, among whom the median age was mine plus six or ten years. My schedule was a series of marvelous adventures. Regrettably, I didn't blog.  Cambridge Carnival in September.    Julia Ellermeier, '14 and Christopher Sarabalis, '14 at FreshGrass    FreshGrass Bluegrass & Roots Festival at Mass MoCA, North Adams.    A sculpture at Mass MoCA.    Bryant Pond, Maine with the MCP (Masters in City Planning) crowd. November and December: I did psets. I did psets and wrote essays. I wrote essays. I still loved most of my classes. I loved Voice and Meaning, the writing class I took with Ta-Nehisi Coates, the best teacher I've had in my entire life aside from my dad*. I loved the half-semester class I took on multimedia and place-based storytelling. That ended, and the psets kept coming, and I waxed nostalgic for high school days--not because I wanted to be in high school again, but because I missed having time to lie down. I stressed out. I came close to a couple of meltdowns. I counted on my roommates to help me chill out. I made half-formed jokes, drank buckets of tea, and cooked for forty every Friday night. That's how pika works. It was a hell of a semester--mostly in a good way,  not always, but mostly. I'm still sorting it out in my head. I'm drawing conclusions.**   At the end, I went home. I have a few homes now: the one I live in, the one I left, the one my family keeps. I went back to Santa Fe, where it could be t-shirt weather with snow on the ground, snow only in the shadows of junipers, where there are Christmas cholla blooming yellow and the Center for Contemporary Arts shows movies every night and serves popcorn with nutritional yeast. The bookstore I frequent in Santa Fe was once a jail that held Billy the Kid. My family lives in a small rented adobe two blocks from my sister's elementary school, a mile from the old city plaza. In the days leading up to Christmas, people line the sidewalks with farolitos (tea lights in paper bags weighed down with sand), and on Christmas Eve, an informal parade flows up Canyon Road. There are campfires in driveways, where you can stand by strangers to warm your hands, and there are jugs of hot cider set out unattended for you to drink. There are men in top hats playing carols on trombones and couples holding hands. Home was beautiful. My family is crazy and good. I read a lot at home, and I started writing poetry. Tonight, after dinner, I brought out my stacks of books and offered my friends prescriptions. "Tell me your problems and your life, and I'll give you a poem to address them." They asked for poems to address existential angst, pretty girls, and sleeplessness. I did my best. I'll do it for you, too.

Christmas Eve in Santa Fe, New Mexico. Photo credit to Jacob Ahrens-Balwit, UW-Madison.  *Having a five-year-old sister, I get to see for myself, from a new perspective, how my dad taught me about the world. My last night in Santa Fe, he told a bedtime story in which Wee Willy Winky and Jacques Cousteau were brothers. The acronym 'scuba' stood for "little can of air I strap on my back." While Wee Willy Winky made his nightly rounds, Jacques Cousteau learned how to breathe underwater. When W.W.W. returned home, exhausted by the effort of convincing rowdy kids go to bed, brother Jacques told him stories of shimmering turquoise water and strange colorful fish. In a surprising twist, W.W.W. has sleep apnea, and when he falls asleep in the middle of his brother's story, Jacques hooks him up to the little can of air. Wee Willy Winky dreams of marvelous fish and a man in scuba gear swimming toward him. **Conclusion number one is that I have to blog more. I write all the time, but I have a little stage fright. I talk to strangers all the time, but not to so many at once, and not from such a distance, the way I'm talking to you right now. My next blog post, in one week, will contain the rest of my conclusions.   Hi Everyone, The MIT February Updates and Notes Form is now available on MyMIT. Wait! Before you fill this form out, please read some important info below. What is it?The MIT February Updates and Notes Form is an online form that is required of all students (including those admitted or deferred in Early Action), and is to be completed by you, the applicant. This form serves two purposes: to share your newest grades, and give you an opportunity to mention other updates since you submitted your application.Who should fill it out?Everyone! Even those already accepted in Early Action. When should I fill it out?As soon as possible after grades are available for the fall semester or second quarter. (If your school uses a trimester schedule, please use your first trimester grades, even if we already have them.) Please send us the form once your grades are released, OR by February 15th, whichever is earlier. The form must be submitted no later than February 15th.Wait! I wont have any grades before February 15th!Even if you have no new grades to report, you should still complete the February Updates and Notes Form. You should then submit your midyear grades to us as soon as theyre available. My counselor/school already sent my midyear grades. Do I still need to submit the form?Yes. You are still required to complete the form with your latest grades. My school does not provide midyear grades or progress reports. Do I still need to submit the form?Yes. There is an option where you can indicate this. I am homeschooled. Do I still need to submit the form?Yes. You should provide any and all grades available for classes youve taken in your current academic year. I am no longer attending school. Do I still need to submit the form?Yes. There is an option where you can indicate this.Got it. Ok, how do I fill this form out?The form has fields for you to report your coursework and grades. This is similar to the Self-Reported Coursework Form from the Part 2 of the application, except that we're only looking for current-year courses and grades. And we're only looking for this from students with something to report. If you're in a school that doesn't have midyear grades, or you've already graduated, don't worry, you're all set  just skip this section.Next, we have provided you with a simple text box. This is the best place for any new updates you want us to know about. Feel free to write in bullet points or use more casual language. This section has a maximum of 250 words. I know thats not a lot, but do your best to be concise. Remember, the final date to submit the FUN form is February 15th. How do I fill out the grades section? Make it clean please. Like this:Biology             A+AP Calculus    A- Or, if you have quarter grades:English             A, B+Japanese       95,88 Or, if you feel like you need to explain something  put it only in the subject section like this: Java I (taken at B.C.C.)         A+Multivariable Calc (Online) Pass Other special circumstances? One more thing: If you see something missing on your MyMIT Application Tracking, don't worry - we're continuing to process thousands of documents coming in. Once we're caught up, if we're still missing something, we'll send you another email in the next week or two to let you know.Thanks! I pulled a sophomore stupid said my friend as we tried to finish up our last problem set of the year. I laughed, and felt my heart sink as I remembered what it really meant and how we all have done it. We all pulled a sophomore stupid.  I reached my limits, and I really think I learned a lot about what I am capable of. I pre-registered for six classes at the beginning of this semester. There was a CI-H, which I needed to take, but it was the same night as a Writing Science Fiction class that I wanted to take.  I showed up for Writing Science Fiction on the first day extremely excited. Science fiction is my favorite genre, and I would love to take a course from a real science fiction writer. However, the professor only took seniors and juniors, so my sophomore friend and I did not get in. So I was down to four technical classes. I e-mailed a professor about taking her 9-unit class as a fifth class so that I could get a HASS requirement out of the way, but I got no reply and heard from a friend that the class was full. The four technical classes were brutal ones. The first was 3.012, which is a 15-unit two-part class consisting of a structure of materials component and thermodynamics component. The professors were incredible, but the material was extremely frightening. I struggled through the semester, constantly feeling behind, especially after I got sick a few times. Once I started to get healthier, I finally accepted that there was no feasible way I could learn the material on my own and catch up with the class. I met with the TAs and Student Support Services and I finally asked for a tutor in the class. My tutor was awesome and helped me through the material, and she helped me understand that what I am going through in the class is not just happening to me. Sophomore fall is the most difficult part of my major, and after this it gets a lot better.  I really do feel like I learned a ton in the class, and I have accepted that there was no way I could have tried any harder than I did. I now understand all about how materials function, and I feel like I can apply these to real life situations, like we did in my second technical class, 3.014. My second technical class was 3.014, which is a CI-M.  CI-M stands for Communication Intensive class for your Major.  The class involved writing papers and other writing assignments, which would get graded on a technical and writing scale. I did really well in the class, and even enjoyed it to a point. However, all of the assignments were due at the same times and the amount of work was extreme. The Monday of Thanksgiving break week we had 30% of our final grade due. It was an extremely time consuming class, but it definitely reinforced what I learned in 3.012. I am excited, however, to get away from 4-hour lab blocks for a month or two. Also, I got an A in the class. That's right, I GOT MY FIRST A AT MIT!!!  I am so happy!!  I actually never thought I could do it.  I thought that MIT didn't give A's for classes.  Apparenlty professors have the option to put an A on our grade reports, and every once in a while they do it! My third technical class was 3.016, mathematical methods for materials. This class basically taught us how to solve really difficult problems using Mathematica. I am not a programmer, but I did learn some basic skills that were really helpful.  In the end, I made a really cool visualization modeling the Brownian motion of polymers. I definitely learned a lot in this class, and the instructor was really awesome. My last technical class was 5.12, organic chemistry.  This class was my sophomore exploratory.  Sophomore exploratory is a beautiful thing where the drop date for the class is extended until the next semester.  The sophomore exploratory option was perfect for me for this class because 5.12 would not actually count towards the requirements for my major, it was just a class that I really wanted to take because I am really passionate about polymer science. 5.12 ended up taking too much time away from my other classes, and I had to switch it to listener at the end of the semester.  Still, I feel like I now have a basic understanding of chemical reactions and definitely got a lot out of my experience in the class. So those were my classes that I did and did not take, and in the end I really have no regrets. Last semester I was pushed to and past my limits. I learned more than I ever had before about myself and about how to do MIT.  MIT truly is a place where you are forced to drink from the firehose, yet I somehow cannot picture myself anywhere else. And all of my friends are going through the same thing, supporting each other along the way. There are student support services, mental health, our parents, the Medlinks, UAAP, and so many other people around us making sure that we are staying healthy and getting through our sophomore slumps, and that is what gets us through it all in the end. There were a few others things keeping me busy in my very little free time this past semester.  Medlinks I have been very involved in Medlinks here on campus. Medlinks is a student organization that helps students with all things health  from scrapes to gastroenteritis outbreaks to eating healthy.  I really enjoy being a Medlink - and I recently got recognition for all my effort as Medlink of the Month! We even had a Meet the Medlinks event that was a real success last semester in East Campus.  There was a lot of great food...  ...and there were a lot of great Medlinks! We also made goodie bags for all the residents of East Campus to help people get through finals! Associate Advising I am having a lot of fun being an associate advisor this year, and I really want to continue to do this during my time here at MIT!  Although I am still trying to figure out things for myself, I really want to offer whatever advice I can to freshmen and try to make their time at MIT the best it can be!  At the end of last semester, the advisor for our group and I took our advisees out to Toscanini's, the best ice cream business in the Boston area.  Our advisor knows the owner of Tosci's, and we got to sit around and talk about the ice cream business, creation process, and eat a bunch of really great samples!  Additionally, I made our advisees care packages for finals week!  I hope they liked them!  Pistol I have not been nearly as involved in pistol as I would have liked to be this semester, but our team did really well this year! I did get to go to one away match at West Point, and it was so much fun! I love going on away matches because I feel like I get to bond with the team and get to know them.  We also got to hang out with a bunch of the army kids, and we even took them out to get ice cream with us one night!  MIT also beat West Point in the Sport Pistol Event, and Yale in every event!  We have really been kicking butt this season.  UPOP MIT has this really cool program called the Undergraduate Practice Opportunities Program, or UPOP, that helps sophomores practice professionalism and get an internship or other cool opportunity for the summer after their sophomore year.  Through UPOP, I got connected to an awesome company called TMK IPSCO, which is an industry leader in developing piping products for the oil and gas industry.  I went through multiple interview rounds, and finally received and accepted an offer to work at their Houston, Texas-based research and development center this summer! IAP I AM GOING TO BE AN EMT!  Since I was 16, I have wanted to train to be an EMT.  However, I was too young to begin training, so I became a firefighter instead.  I still got to ride in the ambulance on calls to help with carrying items and patients, but I am so excited to finally be able to help to a greater extent, as well as further help people on hall who get injured and have better judgement of when people need to go to the emergency room. The training is a lot of work - classes 9am-6pm Monday to Friday plus extra trainings and tests - but it is something that I have wanted to do for a really long time and I am so excited to help people.  I really do miss it, and I hope that I can make a difference.  All in All Sophomore slump exists.  It is the awful truth that last semester was pretty sucky.  It was emotionally, physically, and mentally draining, but I learned so much and I am really excited for the future.  Next semester will really be awesome.  I am finally going to take some business classes, and I am considering changing my major slightly so that I can take a greater variety and quantity of business classes and take advantage of the incredible opportunities that MIT's Sloan business school has to offer. The Future The future is looking brighter and brighter with each step I take and new thing I learn.  The journey there is really tough, but I am excited to see what comes next.   And of course I will end this blog post with a cat picture!  This is Muffin, a recent visitor to hall!  An animal shelter found him in a bulldozer and now he lives with the sister of Lilika M. '16.  He is six months old and giant.  You: Where are you from?Me: London.You: But you...you don't...you don't seem to have a British accent.Me: Correct. Let me explain! I was born in Singapore, had a Singaporean accent, then moved to London during the summer before fifth... read more  see complete archives  David Helfand: "Unfortunately we don't have time for a formal Q&A session, but I'm sure that Neil would be happy to stick around for a few minutes and answer questions if there are any." We swarmed to the stage while Neil walked to the edge and crouched down to shake hands with ardent fans. My friends and I shoved cameras at each other and posed:   Neil looked around the crowd, and my hand went up first. He made eye contact and pointed at me: "yes! question?" Me: "You talked a lot about how the public's perception of science is changing. I was wondering if you could spend a few minutes talking about how scientists' perception of outreach is changing -- to what extent outreach is valued in the scientific community." Neil deGrasse Tyson (NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON!!!): "Ah, excellent question, and one that is very near to my heart." Random astronomer: "Can you repeat the question? We couldn't hear it from over here." Neil: "The question was, and" - he glanced at me - "let me know if I have this wrong. The question was about how outreach is valued in the professional scientific community."  I nodded. He looked straight at me while giving his answer, and I could sense camerapeople standing all around me. My heart was pounding so loudly in my ears that I'm not sure if I heard anything he said, but here's what I remember.  Neil: "So, Carl Sagan made some mistakes..." (CARL SAGAN MADE MISTAKES???) Neil: "but he was the first [to do highly-visible, large-scale public outreach] so he was allowed to make mistakes. But I'm not the first, so I've been able to learn from his mistakes. Carl often didn't assign credit when he described results from astronomy research. A lot of the people watching his programs thought that HE was the one making all of those discoveries. After he passed away, newspapers wrote things like 'the only award that eluded him was the Nobel Prize!' which they would only have said if they thought that all of the discoveries he talked about were his discoveries. This was work that other scientists might have spent decades of their lives working on -- and Carl was getting all the credit. That made a lot of people resentful. When I describe science research, I'm always careful to attribute it to the group who worked on the project. When a newspaper calls me up and asks for comments, I always direct them back to the group who did the work. And then I might make a comment that just seals a ribbon on the group's comments.  Also, I never talk about my own research. I don't use my platform as an opportunity to advertise my personal results. My specialty is galaxies, but almost nobody knows that. I talk about whatever I think would captivate the public the most, and I call up colleagues if I don't know much about it.  I've never felt any antagonism from the professional astronomy community, and I think that that's because I always give them credit for their work." At this point, it was nearly 10 pm. My friends and I had arrived at 7:30 (with our Mexican take-out food in hand) to claim second-row seats, which turned out to be a fabulous idea because the auditorium filled up. In the AAS meeting schedule, the event was advertised as the following: *** Monday, 8:00 PM - 9:00 PM; Potomac Ballroom A The public's access to our field has historically occurred through traditional conduits of communication such as television documentaries, planetarium shows, and media reports. But in the past five years social media has arisen as a means of attracting people who would never have imagined they had an interest in the universe, or in science at all. The results are stunning and unexpected, with millions of people responding to various offerings of the universe made in these media. Twitter and Facebook lead the way, but other Internet social media have proven potent as well, including YouTube, Reddit, Google+, and, more broadly, the blogosphere. We give first-hand stories and accounts of forays on this landscape and offer suggestions on how such efforts may benefit the long-term health of modern astrophysics from having cultivated public support at its deepest levels. *** His thesis:   Defending this thesis involved a discussion of memes (you know that you've really made it when you're a meme!) and I can report that it is truly bizarre to watch Neil deGrasse Tyson present memes of himself. Like this one:  Apparently he does pay attention to the memes people make of him, so I encourage you to go out and be creative -- and maybe your artwork will feature in his next presentation about social media. :) He also told us about the time he did a few calculations to "find" Superman's home planet within the exoplanet catalogue, and ended up in a comic:  If you have sharp eyes, you'll notice that he was wearing this vest on stage.  He also talked about Facebook. If you have a Facebook page, you've heard of the page "I Fucking Love Science." IFLS has just under nine and a half MILLION Likes, and originates from Neil Tyson's stint on the Daily Show.  He explained that, before getting on the show, he spent a lot of time studying Jon Stewart's verbal habits. He paid attention to how many sentences Stewart usually grants a guest on his show before inserting a witty comment. He paid attention to what kinds of words or phrases Stewart particularly likes to pick up on. So, when he went on the show, he made sure to describe astronomy using sexually suggestive language, which prompted Stewart to say "WHY IS IT THAT WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT SCIENCE YOU TURN ME ON?" and then, "I FUCKING LOVE SCIENCE."  Neil has a busy schedule, and after I asked my question one of his AMNH colleagues got up on stage and began dragging him off of it. As he was leaving, another member of the audience asked what he thinks the US role is in influencing international science policy, and in between steps he shouted something about how he wouldn't claim that we have enough of an understanding of other cultures. His colleague tugged even harder on his arm, and Neil moonwalked off the stage to shrieks and applause. "ASTRONOMERS!" he yelled. "LEARN TO MOONWALK! YOU'LL NEED IT SOME DAY!" He didn't make it to the door, because so many people swarmed around him holding out their scientific poster labels and official conference badges for him to sign. It was the scientist equivalent of a rock concert.  My friends and I let him go, though, and we all went back up to our rooms to post pictures of the event on Facebook. With all that discussion of social media, it seemed like the appropriate thing to do. I'm currently sitting in the SeaTac airport, waiting for my flight back to Boston that's been delayed for ~2 hours. One part of me is ecstatic to get back to campus after a much needed break, to see my MIT friends again and thoroughly enjoy IAP. But another part of me is mourning my early departure from the west coast while my closest high school friends remain here for another couple of weeks. That, and my family will be going to Seahawks playoff game(s) while I'm stuck yelling at a TV about 3,051 miles away. I think if you were to ask me point blank, "Where is home?" I would say Kirkland, Washington. It's where I've spent most of my life, where my family is and I return for the holidays, where I can get behind the wheel after six months of no driving and navigate the roads by a map carved into my memory. A home base, if you will; a place where I'll always be able to return no matter where my adventures take me. And because of this sense of stability, this idea that I'll always have somewhere safe in the world, I've never been that afraid of uprooting my life and continuing to grow elsewhere. The idea of flying 6 hours (+/- the 3 hour time zone shift) away from everywhere I've known was far less frightening than the idea of finding out my careful college decision was wrong--that MIT was not the right school for me, after all. Establishing MIT as a second home hasn't been the easiest idea to pound into my often-stubborn brain, to be honest. I didn't immediately have the "IHTFP" (of the paradise-variety) mentality. This past semester, especially, made me question my motivation, talent, future goals, mental health, and decision to stay enrolled in an expensive school while my parents are funding my education. While the strong friendships I've forged over the past year and a half are a wonderful support system, I spent a lot of time introspectively thinking what I, personally, needed/wanted from a school and as a next stage in life. And I'm still not sure I have an answer. What I did decide:   Anyway, my flight is boarding in approximately 5 minutes, I think I've hit the deep thoughts limit for this post, and I'm ready to read a couple of books and get back to my on-campus family.  Update: My flight did not actually board in approximately 5 minutes. Because of the ruthlessness of bad luck, it was cancelled and I had to stand in a line with 300 other people until 2am trying to rebook. Not because of the weather, mind you, but because the first officer didn't show up. Oh well... back to campus as soon as possible!   Signing in from sunny foggy and snowy and icy and rainy Greenbelt, Maryland, down the road from Goddard Space Flight Center, where I'll be interning for the next four weeks during Independent Activities Period (IAP) before second semester start in February. And I'm alone. No classmates down the hall. No classmates down the stairs. No classmates anywhere nearby, really. Possibly more importantly, no meal plans or dining halls in sight. (side note: my condolences to all those left high and dry when the IAP meal plan program back on campus got canceled. We share the same struggles. Let us commiserate. Maybe you'll find this shopping list below useful?) first sunrise in Baltimore, Saturday morning, from an airplane. Last Friday, my older brother (MIT '11) and I took off from San Francisco after being patted down by a very kind TSA agent while one of his coworkers cracked snide comments (something something "MIT" something "not Caltech"). We landed in Baltimore close to 7 AM Saturday morning, after a redeye flight that was miraculously not canceled due to inclement weather. After orienting ourselves and collecting my luggage, we hopped on a shuttle to a Zipcar station where we were greeted by the Volkswagen Golf my brother had reserved, as well as the cute fluffy snow-and-ice hat that it had recently acquired and was proudly wearing on its windshield. Unfortunately the snow had to go if the car was to be at all usable, so when we finally figured out how to open the trunk to look for the ice scraper Zipcar should have left us (opening the trunk on a Volkswagen Golf is, surprisingly enough, a nontrivial challenge in itself), we looked eagerly into the trunk's corners and pockets to find...nothing. Uh.  Fortunately when I called Zipcar the nice lady at the other end worked some magic and unlocked one of the other Zipcars so we could steal their ice scraper instead. This California boy and his brother then spent their first half-hour in Maryland hacking, scraping, and waging war on the ice and snow until the car was in an operable state. These are problems we never have to deal with in California.  We spent the rest of the day carting ourselves all over Maryland in our hard-earned car to go grocery shopping. I wasn't exactly planning on eating out every single day, which would be both expensive and unhealthy. We decided to get the bare necessities for lunch sandwiches (lettuce, bread, and deli meat), plus hella frozen goods for easy dinners, as well as some assorted snacks for, well, snacking. Here's the final grocery list, commented: TRADER JOE'S:Lunch Stuff: Frozen Dinnerable Things: Snacks For Snacking: Other: Total: $136.61 [not bad for all those noms.]   WHOLE FOODS MARKET: Total: $49.54 [okay seriously though, why is individually packaged milk priced at $1.50/box? oh right--Whole Foods.]   SAFEWAY: Total: $16.38 (with Safeway membership card) [sounds about right for assorted goods]   GRAND TOTAL: $202.53, or ~$7.23/day I'll keep y'all posted as to how I do this month about staying fed. Maybe I have too much food. Maybe I'll have too little and starve to death (although with the amount of delicious home-baked goods my mom insisted I bring along, that seems unlikely). I don't know. It's an adventure! Exciting! In any case, the eating is much cheaper than the MIT meal plan, so if this month goes well I'll have more confidence about the possibilty of moving into another dorm and going without a meal plan next year.  Evening came, and morning followed--the first day.Sunday (today) was a little less interesting. I went downtown to Washington D.C. with my brother on the metro, and upon arrival at the National Mall, the conversation went something like this:Brother: So that's the Washington Memorial. That's the Capitol Building. These are like office buildings. Those are Smithsonian buildings.Me: ...coool.Brother: So where do you wanna go? We only have one or two hours, tops.Me: ...Brother: We could do touristy stuff and go see things or we could go to the Air and Space Museum.Me: ...Me: ...let's go to the Air and Space Museum. ...and we spent the entire morning there. Course 16 at heart. I almost cried in front of the original Wright Flyer. guys that is THE original Wright Flyer from the 1903 Kitty Hawk flights *screams*   Oh, and I got pictures of some other cool things in the neighborhood on the way:    So that's the weekend. After my brother left, I told myself to make a sandwich and I made my first sandwich. It is my very own sandwich and I will eat it with pride tomorrow at my first day of work at Goddard Space Flight Center. I don't know much about what I'll be doing yet but it's sure to be very scientific and engineersome and I'm going to learn tons. I'll keep you posted. ~Allan You: Where are you from?Me: London.You: But you...you don't...you don't seem to have a British accent.Me: Correct. Let me explain! I was born in Singapore, had a Singaporean accent, then moved to London during the summer before fifth... read more  see complete archives  On New Year's Eve, my family went out to see Book of Mormon. When I wasn't laughing, wincing, or wondering about the ceiling's structural integrity, I was glancing over at the guy sitting next to my sister, who shrieked with laughter and rocked back and forth (amplitude ~3 feet. very impressive!) after every joke. And there are a lot of jokes in Book of Mormon.  After the show finished and the performers had taken a few bows, Elder Price frantically waved his hands and shhh'd the audience. After we fell silent, he cued Elder McKinley, who asked us to join the cast in a rendition of Auld Lang Syne. And then the whole theater had linked arms and was swaying back and forth, and the cast had linked arms and were swaying back and forth like a miniature reflection, singing Should auld acquaintance be forgot, and never brought to mind? while I sang duh nuh nuh! since I don't know the lyrics to the song. While we walked to the tube station (along with half of London, it seemed) I heard at least five or six different languages shuffle past. That night, my family joined 13.7 million people in watching the broadcast of another rendition of Auld Lang Syne, followed by the countdown and an astonishingly spectacular fireworks display that you should really watch if you haven't already. The BBC estimated that a quarter of a million people were packed shoulder-to-shoulder by the Thames that night. Thursday morning (the 2nd) I said goodbye to London and flew to Washington, D.C. Very groggy, I sat down and made it through two sentences of Blue Mars before an elderly couple came over and asked me whether I was in the right seat. ...Nope. I moved.  In case I hadn't caused enough offense, I accidentally trebuchetted a spoonful of frosting into the woman's lap after the crew handed out afternoon tea. Not my finest 8.5-hour flight! I did have some successes: I watched 5/7 episodes from Season 1 of Breaking Bad and napped for a couple of hours. Anyway, we all made it in one piece. This afternoon, I arrived at my hotel and for a few minutes wondered whether I had accidentally stumbled into a theme park. There were more wigs than real hair, elves and staffs and battle armor and face paint and an impressive variety of weapons. I passed a room labeled "LARPing". My elevator company included a guy in a full cat costume (I only knew it was a guy by his voice). Eventually, I stopped someone and interrogated him. Turns out that this convention center is being used for a Music & Gaming Festival! No wonder.  I congratulated the guy on his cat costume, then searched my room for a fridge, with grand plans to get Thai take-out and save some for later.  No fridge.  NO FRIDGE???? Distraught, I went out into the hallway with the hope of finding some kind of communal fridge. I bumped into my neighbor, who was walking out of his room and wearing a MAGfest badge. Me: Hey! Do we have a fridge in our room? He took a few seconds to respond, presumably to figure out that I meant "are there fridges in these rooms?" and not "do we have a fridge in the room that we are (surprise!!) sharing?" Just then, another MAGfest guy came down the hallway, and asked us whether we would like to join a hotel-wide game of Assassins. I answered "yes" on behalf of myself and my neighbor (he shrugged as if he didn't care, but I knew he wanted to play!) and all three of us hung out for ten minutes or so. Turns out that my neighbor has been coming to MAGfest for nine years, and that those nine years have been enough to see its attendance increase from hundreds to about twelve thousand. I also learned that "cosplay" isn't really his thing, and that cosplay is annoying because it's very time-consuming, because if you're going to dress up like your favorite character from a video game you have to do it exactly right or people will judge you. We all went our separate ways, and my neighbor told me that I was welcome to join various MAGfest parties.  Half an hour later, when I was heading out to buy my pad thai, I bumped into my two new friends again and it made me happy to be able to say hi and address them by name. And I found the fridge: it is in fact disguised as a set of drawers, presumably because thieves usually go for the fridge first. And now it's 10 PM and my body says that it's 3 AM because it's stubbornly insisting on Greenwich Mean Time. Tomorrow is Day 1 of a two-day workshop that I could not be more excited about. I'll keep you posted! For now, good night, strangers! This New Year, I want to try a resolution that would mandate how I approach the rest of my goals throughout the year: Should any of my goals fail, I will revive them from where I left off INSTANTLY in some way. No starting over. No delays to tomorrow, next week, or next month. No more "I should review for Physics. I know, I'll start at Chapter 1, page 1."Instead: "I'm going to figure out my weak points in Physics and work my way outward from there rather than starting from page 1 every review." No more "I'll just get by this semester and be more organized next semester."Instead: "I am pulling out my calender as we speak to write down all my remaining due dates and to start studying right now." Now that I have my resolution to not start over or delay anytime a goal falls short, I need some goals to go along with it. I'll also start small, with three goals for January that I can work on during IAP:1. Simplify and keep track of my finances.3. Go through the INSANITY workout program for a full 60 days.3. Write at least three blog posts a month.   In order to save money while at MIT, I pulled together all of my rewards cards and coupons.  I joined a credit union that had a rewards program where I earned points for using my debit card.  I filled out any surveys that could get me free thing and I downloaded apps on my phone that would earn me money for watching advertisements. But, during my first semester, I ended up not using any of the them. The Subway in the Student Center doesn't accept rewards points, so I couldn't use my Subway card unless I wanted to hike outside of campus looking for another Subway. I never used any of the Rite Aid or CVS coupons I had clipped, as I found myself buying anything I really needed either online at cheaper prices, at Shaw's (a supermarket off of Mass Ave), or at La Verde's (a 24-hour convenience store in the Student Center). All the apps I watched ads on and the surveys I took earned me a total of about two dollars. And after one full year of using my debit card on things like a laptop, a mini-fridge, and even airline tickets, I only earned enough points for a $10 Amazon gift card. Now, instead, I resolve to not care so much about squeezing out every single penny I can. I'd rather use the time for doing better at my job or for learning new things. As a college student I found that the only rewards cards that have helped me are my AMC Theatres card which I use back home and my Best Buy card which I use frequently when I make tech purchases. Second, I want to have an easy and automated way to track my spending. I opened an account with the MIT Federal Credit Union (partially because I get a debit card with "MIT" on it and a free shirt). I linked my MITFCU account with my Mint.com account so I can see my current balance and all of my previous transactions from my phone or laptop, helping me keep track of my college expenses and making sure I'm gaining money rather than losing it. Lastly, I also wanted to get my recurring payments in order. I made a spreadsheet listing any recurring payments I had and when they had to be paid, so that I'll know what needs to be paid and when so that I won't have unexpected withdrawals or overdraft fees hit me.   For a full year before my first semester at MIT, I trained at the Hawthorne Institute of Martial Arts. During my time there, I went from training 3 times a week to 5 times a week, earning my green belt just four days before leaving for MIT. I made a mistake thinking that, at MIT, exercise would fit naturally into my schedule. When the semester started, I found that I had a both a lack of time and motivation to exercise. Notice how exercise isn't even listed. Throughout first semester, I explored the various options MIT offers for staying in shape, including: -joining a sport or club-going to the Z-Center-going to the Simmons gym-exercising in my dorm room-going running on MIT's track or around the Charles River and Boston-joining a gym or club off-campus While adjusting to MIT's intense workload, I wasn't able to put in all the time necessary to go to the Z-Center on a regular basis. Now I know that I need to start off with an exercise routine with a minimal time commitment as I slowly start going to the gym more frequently. I've done fragments of the INSANITY workout program in the past, but I had never completed the program from start to finish. I resolve to go through the INSANITY program from start to finish. I'd be able to do it easily in my dorm room for just 40 minutes a day. I started it yesterday (January 1st) and I'm going through the first week here at home so that when I get back to MIT I'll already have a week done and be in a routine. Since I can barely find free time during the day, I'm going to try making time to exercise in the morning. This means *gulp* waking up earlier. I've had such a problem with this last semester. I stayed up so late so many nights doing PSets that now I sleep until the very last possible minute that I could wake up and make it to class on time. So for IAP I'll be testing out new methods for waking up earlier. One of them even goes so far as to involve going to bed earlier. I know, right? Crazy!     One down, two to go. ~Erick We begin with certain trivialities. *Resolution: A firm decision to do or not to do something;*New Years Resolution: On Jan 1, it means: I'll go the gym starting tomorrow!! And from this week on, I'll gym 3 times a week. I'll be strong, fit, the works. On Jan 2, it means: ahhhhhh, that was today? Well, still gotta enjoy the year. It's only just begun; can't be stressing about working out. I'll start tomorrow. On Jan 7, it means: Well, the week is up. I'll definitely start tomorrow. On Jan 31, it means: Meh, was a busy month; definitely first week of February. On Feb 20, it means: How did I gain 90 pounds? Aaargh! Gotta start soon. On April 19, it means:  Well I can't fit through my door but that's fine, cuz I promised to work out this year, and that I will. Soon! On August 23, it means: Um...yeah, year is almost over. Might as well start in 2015. On November 29, it means: Yeah. I...I'm not gonna work out. On December 30: aaaaaaaaaargh! On December 31: BEEP! Nada. BEEP! nothing BEEP! Nope. Well, let's hand it over to the museum. Wait, wait, AAAARGH!!!!  IT HAS ITS OWN GRAVITATIONAL PULL!!!! HELP, I'M BEING SUCKED IN! AAAAARGH!!!!  BLACKHOLE!!!! And that folks, is what will happen if you break your resolution this year.--Its 2014! 2013 was the year of Wrecking Ball, What Does the Fox Say, the premiere of the Class of 2017, the finale of the class of 2013, the government shutdown, and a host of millions of occurrences, good, bad, unremarkable, all contained within this large timeline that appears to have whizzed by. 2013 is also alliterative, composite, mathematically deficient and bygone, physics experiments on relativity notwithstanding. For the even slightly sentimental, there might be this feeling that 2014 should open up with some sort of bangperformers at Times Square, raining confetti and showers of fireworks come to mind. I wasnt quite sure how to start up the New Year. Should I eat till I was blue in the face, run naked through a neighborhood, cuddle a kitten? These lame and not at all self-conscious ideas fell apart at the feet of the simplest solution: write. Writing is fun. Thats why I do it so much. Believe it or not, there was a time 2013 was still fresh as that p-set so new you havent even thought about it long enough to think about procrastinating about it. And I remember less than three hours into the year, I waxed philosophical in a fairly lengthy essay, pondering if the segue into a new year bore any true meaning or was just a new page on a wall calendar. This year, Im going into it writing a short, dark, fictional story about new beginnings, which I can send to you via e-mail upon request: [email protected]/* <![CDATA[ */(function(){try{var s,a,i,j,r,c,l,b=document.getElementsByTagName("script");l=b[b.length-1].previousSibling;a=l.getAttribute('data-cfemail');if(a){s='';r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16);for(j=2;a.length-j;j+=2){c=parseInt(a.substr(j,2),16)^r;s+=String.fromCharCode(c);}s=document.createTextNode(s);l.parentNode.replaceChild(s,l);}}catch(e){}})();/* ]]> */ Regardless of sentiments, theres a whole lot to look forward to this year, and a small chance for reflection. This, of course, gives rise to those well-loved and oft-broken resolutions. My resolutions this year are to: *Write more stories *Explore more of Boston with my roommate *Know the people in my dorm better *Start p-sets earlier *Make new friends in MIT *Eat better *Stay organized *Hang out with certain people more often *Hit the gym three times a week, starting Monday. Can't believe I typed that last one with a straight face :/ What are your resolutions this year? Any particularly outlandish ones?  To think That one year ago, MIT said Yes, you can go. My family rejoiced, my friends cheered. Looking back, I cant believe its been a whole year. Finals are over. First semester is done. Now its time for relaxing fun. With the family and friends back home. Im getting to see how much everyone has grown. However, Reflecting back, I see that I too have grown. Here are a few things I learned on my own: Laundry is very important. Neglect it you should not. The workload can be overwhelming, but give it all you got. Everyones afraid of failing. In each of our classes, theres so much to learn. But I found no use complaining, I just kept on working and got the grades that I earned. Whew! That was crazy. Time for holiday cheer. But no time to get lazy. 2nd semester is near. Go have a nice holiday. And see you next year! Nine days ago, I was at the Boston Logan Airport, and it felt strange--it was the farthest Id been from the MIT bubble in months. When the plane took off, Boston dropped beneath me, a sea of darkness cut through by millions of nighttime lights. I pressed my face to the window, not quite sure how I felt. It was this strange mixture of disbelief and excitement. My first semester in MIT was over. Since then, Ive been with my aunt and her family in North Carolina. Weve been visiting relatives, eating awesome Nigerian foodhow I missed that!and looking forward to a wedding thats been on everyones mind for the past week. The pre-wedding dinner was last night, and it might be the strangest and most fun thing Ive seen all week. From the ululating screams of the women followed by fluid circular dancing to a synchronized warble my cousins shimmied to, the heavy African undertone was all too reminiscent of home. So, although its likely I wont be there till summer of next year, I really miss Nigeria. I missed it in MIT too, the food, the drama, the culture, although those feelings were often buried under the breakneck pace of classes and piling mounds of p-sets. The week prior to finals, my roommate James Deng and I did visit a Nigerian restaurant in Boston called Suya Joint (suya being a tasty and extremely spicy meat). It was a memorable experience (and not just because it took two buses, the T, and an hour to get there). I didnt hesitate to take with me some leftover ogbono soup when I couldnt finish everything wed ordered. -- Speaking of memorable...the snow. Oh my God, the snow. There hasnt been any snow in North Carolina since Ive been here, but thats fine, because the image from Boston still lingers in my head. I saw snow for the first time earlier this month. I woke up thirty minutes before my first class, and rushed into this speedy rage, trying to shower and brush and have breakfast and dress up at the same time. When I burst out of my dorm, I was so frenzied that the first stupid thought that came to my head, and I kid you not, was, Why is it raining dandruff? And then I saw the sheets of snow on the ground, the millions of flakes pouring from the sky. It wasnt dandruff, I observed astutely. It was...SNOW. My jaw dropped. For perhaps a full minute, I stood outside, staring in unbroken awe at the air. I dont know how long it took me to recover, but I did shut my mouth and head to class as quickly as I could. For the next three days, I looked forward to snowy days, to catching flakes in my handsand sometimes, without choice, in my mouth. However, by the fourth day, the snow morphed into some monstrous full-blown downpour. You'd think it would know its bounds! Darn snow, Id mumble angrily, while it assaulted me, drawing a film of white across my glasses and peppering my clothes with endless flecks. I guess snow and I have a love-hate relationship, because right now, Im looking forward to seeing a bit more of it over the coming months without, you know, becoming a human popsicle. -- It really does take understanding what happened during my gap year to put to perspective just how much I appreciate being at MIT, and I promise, Ill blog about it soon. Ive been thinking of all the things that happened this semester, trying to summarize them, but I cant. The blogs try to capture snippets of MIT life, but the continuous, overall sense of what the Institute has felt like the past four months somehow seems beyond the ability of words. There's the often-said energy of students, reflected in their hurried paces through the Infinite Corridor, their fervor in talking about their work, the vivid pictures they paint when describing the odds surmounted in a bygone hell week. Then theres the up-and-down curve of work heresometimes it feels good. Theres joy in challenge, in starting out having absolutely no idea how to begin a problem set, and figuring out most of it a couple of hours later. Sometimes, it feels really...bleh. Its dark outside, pressing quiet aside from the rumble of cars. A few people are still in the lounge studying or watching Pokemon or some anime or Rebecca Black or The Walking Dead. For you, theres a p-set or a midterm that requires a lot of stress-inducing attention due to some build-up of work from the past few days, or to the fact that, you know, its 3AM in the morning, you just dont want to touch this. You don't want to but you have to; you need to. And of course, there are those around you. By day, my roommate is Advanced Chemistry vigilante and SAT tutor; by night, hes the typical thought-buried p-setting MIT student; by early morning, hes an awesome, awesome friend, taking a study break beside me while we watch Breaking Bad together and appropriately exclaim in open-mouthed awe at the continuously brilliant plot-twists. Its a lot of fun being with the people here. One second, theyre discussing algorithmic efficiency and geometric invariants with each other (or just how much their week sucks). The next, theyre singing very, very badly to karaoke songs (kidding, delete one very) or playing video games or just pressing you about that special someone you stare at for all fifty minutes of Multivariable Calculus. At its core, MIT is a community of people who arent merely brilliant and quite apt at undertaking the challenges of a really difficult curriculum, who are here in the first place because theyre quirky, friendly, full of life, deeply in love with something, and can optimistically make a mark in society. When deeply entrenched in the bubble, its easy to take them for granted, but if you stop to think about it, theres always gratitude at their presence. At its worst, MIT will drain you and kick you and punch you and proceed to slam your battered body against the alchemist statue. Then it will you flush you down the toilet and drag you out by ...well, you get the imagery. At its best, its a very, very happy place filled with people you admire, inspire, care about or some combination of those three. Over what has been an incredibly fruitful semester, Ive made and lost friends while navigating the labyrinthine workload here. Ive made stupid mistakes and amazed myself. Ive laughed and clapped hard, whether it was at a student a capella concert or a student-group Shakespeare rendition of Hamlet. Ive met some of the most accomplished people I might ever have the fortune of meeting. I interacted with professors whose accomplishments might fill several pages of a novel, things you couldnt tell from watching them make sappy puns about pizza and play around with food (concourse professors come to mind). And beyond the semester for me has been the college experience itself, watching an electrifying dance at Boston University, exploring restaurants with my friends, seeing movies at the Loews Theater near the Commons, sitting quietly by the Alchemist Statue and watching people play Frisbee on the Kresge Lawn. -- A recent e-mail from an international student asked me what my favorite memory thus far from MIT is. Boy, thats hard. So many good ones. Cant really say, but maybe, in a weird way...maybe its all the way back during Orientation week, when making friends simply took five seconds, when the Class of 2017 was this gigantic bundle of joy and excitement and unrepressed energy talking about high school and an upcoming semester and how awesome MIT would be. When, of course, the food was surplus and free. When we were still discovering the several physical and non-physical aspects of the Institute. We were scavengers, archaeologists, our smiles unending, our hopes high, much of MIT unexplored, awaiting our rock-piercing hammers and sharp-ended shovels. Ive come a long way since that week, and maybe the reason I love it so much is that I can feel how much Ive grown since then. You wouldnt believe how certain I was that I would dive head-on into the waiting classes and p-sets, never to complain about them, to always do them on time, to be the most studious, most hardworking boy there ever was. This...didnt quite happen. Some weeks were good because those were just good weeks. Some were good because I planned well. Some weeks were bad because those were just awful, awful weeks. Some were bad because I exhibited all the management skills of a chimpanzee on rollerblades. But it all comes down to this: in my second blogpost on this site, I wrote: I felt it sink over me, the awe of MIT, the awe of its history reaching up from invisible depths to welcome me with open arms, the awe of what lay ahead, the awe of what was coming. I felt happy. Months have gone by since then, and those last three words are still true. Right now, I feel happy. Making the choice to attend MIT was a personal one, and for me, it was the right one. Regardless of the clash of good and bad times Ive had here, I feel happy. I would choose MIT again without thinking about it. The fall semester is over. I passed all my classesgoodbye, Biology, you were beautiful, but you also used my body as a pinata. My websis account says Ive gained 54 Institute units and satisified 4 GIR requirements.  Spring semester is on the way. I understand whats coming a whole lot better than I did at the time I wrote my second blog. I also know I dont really know whats coming. In its own way, MIT is a conundrum. You cant always tell how things are gonna be, a class, a midterm, a friend, an experience. They can all change without warning. One thing I do know for certain is that the next semester is going to be a lot more challenging. Its the end of Pass/No Record. I'm also going to take harder classes. We think you and MIT are a great match. Words on my letter of admission Ill never forget, words that are true to anyone who reads them on theirs. The MIT experience is a powerful one. Spring is going to be fun. Its also going to be incredibly rough. What a semester its been. I look forward to the next. You: Where are you from?Me: London.You: But you...you don't...you don't seem to have a British accent.Me: Correct. Let me explain!

I live in French House. Nous avons beaucoup de traditions. Towards the end of fall semester, we hold Diner de Noel, a fancy formal dinner. We decorate the lounge at the bottom of the New House 6 staircase:  And, as is our nature, we do all the cooking. This year, the menu included:      along with mashed potatoes, roasted vegetables (brussels sprouts, bell peppers, onions, sweet potatoes), cranberry sauce, turkey, asparagus and squash lasagna, tiramisu, and some kind of pumpkin roll cake thing. At this point, you're wondering WHO COULD POSSIBLY EAT THAT MUCH FOOD??? The answer is: 25 undergraduate residents + 1 GRT, 4 dates, 1 brother, and something like 7 or 8 alums.  In the weeks leading up to Diner de Noel, we have a Secret Santa gift exchange. Each resident spends ~$20-$30 on some number of gifts for a randomly-assigned other resident. At the dinner, we make two guesses about who our Secret Santa is, unwrap our final present, then get one more guess. Secret Santa reveals him or herself, and there is much love and hugging.  I was Secret Santa to Caitlin '15. We share a love of Doctor Who and Lord of the Rings, and Caitlin plays the harp (yeah, she's awesome) so I got her a pair of TARDIS earrings and "Into the West" harp music. I managed to keep my identity a secret :)  I LOVE YOU CAITLIN! Then, it was my turn. My clues were: 0) Secret Santa probably plays an instrument, because all my gifts were wrapped in music-themed paper. This doesn't really narrow things down in French House (or at MIT generally).  1) Secret Santa knows that my boyfriend has facial hair, because he or she gave me this button  I pinned the button on my backpack. Last week, I flew back home to London, and while I stood in line to board the plane some man behind me yelled (over the heads of the people standing between us) YOU LIKE MUSTACHES???? I was totally mortified and didn't say anything. The man kept yelling. YOU LIKE MUSTACHES??? I MAKE MUSTACHE WAX!!!!! I HAVE A BUSINESS!!!!! FAMOUS ALL AROUND THE WORLD!!!!!!!!!! I'LL GIVE YOU MY CARD!!!!!!!!!  The other travelers looked amused. 2) Secret Santa knows that I like Doctor Who, because he or she gave me a Dalek stuffed toy.  I clipped the toy to the front of my school backpack, and went to the library to scan receipts. After e-mailing the scanned receipts to myself, I put on my coat to leave and squashed the toy, which blurted out (very loudly):  YOU ARE AN ENEMY OF THE DALEK!!!!!! It makes noise?!? Despairing, I started jogging for the door, while the Dalek announced to everyone in the library (who presumably wanted nothing more than Silence in the Library) that YOU MUST BE DESTROYED!!!!! 3) My turn. I guessed two people, incorrectly. Then I received my third present and....woah. GIGANTIC BOX. Astonished, I unwrapped it and...WOAH. WOAH. WOAH. WOAH. WOAH. WOAH. WOAH. Best. Secret Santa gift. Ever.  It was a telescope, and I spent the rest of the ceremony totally distracted with assembling it. After my third failed guess, Adam '15 revealed himself.  THANK YOU ADAM!!!! <3     (Photo credit for these two goes to Julie H. '11) I was amazed by how personal each gift was. Because each Secret Santa obviously dedicated a lot of thought to the gift exchange, the following (incomplete) list will give you a strong sense of French House personalities and interests: After dinner and festivities, tradition is to take lots of pictures and sing carols. We took the usual Course 8 picture:  And my sister and I took a picture :)  Happy holidays, everyone! In a nutshell or two: I'm a budding MechE, love building things, and like to pretend I can do a British accent. I'm a writer, a photographer, a Google ninja, a hipster in denial, a fierce advocate of the Oxford comma. And, of course, a... read more  see complete archives  I like to pack light. Maybe it's some combination of old hiking habits, suppressed middle school memories of having my roller backpack kicked around, or watching Up in the Air too many times.   Anyways, every once in a while I get questions about what you should pack before heading off to college.  I won't try to cover everything you should bring (if you're looking for a more exhaustive list, these blog posts might be of interest). Instead, I'll just cover the essentials, aka the things I carry with me every day.  I'd title this something grandiose like The Definitive 21st-Century MIT Student's Everyday Carry, but (1) I'm constantly working to optimize what I carry, so this is a work-in-progress and (2) that title wouldn't fit on the image below.      Antiquated, I know.  But still the best way by far to take notes in most MIT classes.  Equations, diagrams, and graphs are no fun to try to reproduce on a laptop or tablet.  I also find that I retain information more easily when I write it down, as opposed to just typing it out. Using pencil & paper doesn't mean you have to lose the advantages of new technology, though.  Most dorms and libraries have scanners available; I like to scan my notes to PDFs and store them in Evernote.  This has two benefits: (1) Evernote has fairly accurate Optical Character Recognition, meaning you can search through handwritten notes, and (2) you can stop being paranoid about losing your entire semester's worth of notes in your checked luggage when heading home.   Protip: at the beginning of a semester, ask upperclassmen for course "bibles", which contain psets, exams, and (sometimes) lecture notes from previous years; this can save you a lot of time when studying.  Especially if you have lazy professors who provide almost zero exam prep material.  Not that I'm naming names.   Home base for nearly everything I do.  This is my SolidWorks-ing, paper-writing, photo-editing, MATLAB-ing, coding, social-networking, machine. So choose your laptop carefully.  Among my Desired Laptop Attributes: lightness, power, battery life, futureproofness, value. I've found my retina MacBook Pro 15" (2012 model) to be nearly the perfect computer for my purposes: it's 4.5 pounds, is incredibly speedy (2.3 GHz i7, 8GB RAM, 256GB SSD), has a gorgeous screen large enough to display two textbook PDF pages side-by-side, and has a battery life of ~6 hours (the 2013 model has significantly improved battery life).  Be warned, though: it is quite pricey (starting at ~$1700 with a student discount), though similarly powerful and portable PC laptops really aren't that much cheaper. Is paying the Apple premium worth it?  It depends on your needs, and I'm not looking to start a flamewar here.  I will note that a huge advantage of having an Apple computer is customer service.  Last year, my MacBook had some minor display ghosting issues.  Instead of having to ship my laptop off to some Dell warehouse in Texas, I just had to go to the nearby Apple Store, swap my MacBook for a loaner MacBook Air unit, and wait a week before they replaced my screen (for free). In any case, on the PC side I've heard good things about Lenovo laptops.  This one looks interesting. Some useful software/apps: Caffeine - free, gives you a little icon in the OSX menu bar that prevents your Mac from going to sleep for however long you'd like. gfxcardstatus - free, lets you conserve battery life by controlling when your Mac switches to the discrete GPU.     iStatPro - free, a widget that lets you monitor every aspect of your computer, from disk usage to fan speeds. Evernote - free, and a favorite of productivity geeks everywhere.  Just Google it for more information than you'd ever want. Kindle - free, lets you read purchased Kindle books on your computer.  Let's get this out of the way first: no one needs a tablet. And no tablet, Surface or iPad or Nexus or otherwise, is going to replace my laptop anytime soon. That being said, in some contexts a tablet can be a useful supplement to a laptop. I like my retina iPad Mini for curling up in the lounge to read the New York Times or whatever articles I've Instapapered.  On days when I know I won't be writing anything longer than an email, it's all I bring to lecture. (I tried a Nexus 7 for a while - it's also a solid tablet, but I greatly prefer the iPad's 4:3 aspect ratio for web browsing and reading). I'm also experimenting with using my iPad as a productivity tool, making annotations on PDFs using Notability.  I know some classmates who swear by Notability for handwritten notes; I'm still skeptical about writing on a tablet, but we'll see. And that's it!  That's all I have in my backpack.  Feedback?

One of the classes I just finished taking is 8.033, Relativity. Relativity is a great class to teach, if you enjoy designing problems that involve infinitely stacked carts, people running at 80% of the speed of light, people falling into black holes, and people stretching out into strands of spaghetti. Our professor obviously had a good time writing our problem sets, so I thought I would share some particularly amusing excerpts with you. Enjoy!  (The point of the problem was to show that this is not the case, using the fact that velocities don't add linearly at relativistic speeds.)    (Again, the problem was to prove that your uncle is in fact crazy.) Cutest observer ever:     A note on one of our psets, which refers to "Professor Alan Guth," father of inflationary cosmology and Anna H.'s academic advisor :D  And now, onto black holes!

(During freshman orientation week, new MIT arrivals swim four laps (100 yards) in droves, and receive a free t-shirt as a reward for not drowning. If drowning seems plausible, an individual can opt to take an introductory swimming class instead.) When you arrived, drowning was highly plausible, not because you didn't know how to swim but because your ankle was badly sprained and a small bone in your foot was broken. Courtesy of a brutal Ultimate Frisbee injury, you spent the first two weeks at MIT hobbling around on crutches, and didn't get to take the swim test with your friends. :( And now it's December, sub-zero (Celsius) outside, and it occurs to you that breaking your leg could actually prevent you from graduating. You do a quick calculation, and realize that you have had an average of one serious leg/foot/ankle injury per academic year at MIT. Freshman year: that Ultimate Frisbee incident. Sophomore year: the incident with the wheelie chair and the ramp, which landed you in an x-ray facility at Mount Auburn Hospital. Junior year: the incident on the New House 5 staircase, which landed you in an ambulance and MIT Medical. You were on crutches for weeks, thanks to a broken big toe. Senior year: ??? Uh oh. Visions of watching your friends receive their diplomas while you weep in the audience flash through your mind. You have pistol class in a few minutes (for those last two PE Points!) and the swimming pool is right near the range*, so you put on a swimsuit and head on over. *They're separated by lots of wall, don't worry. It's 2pm. Goggles on your forehead, you approach a lifeguard and announce that you are here to take the swim test. She looks at you skeptically. "It's only offered at 8am and 8pm," she says. You say that you saw on the website that it's possible to arrange to take the test at a different time. "Try going to the swim office," she says, waving her hand vaguely in the direction of a solid wall. Okay. You retreat to the locker room, look up the swim office number, and walk over barefoot.  Knock, knock. * * * Six Hours Later * * * You return, except now it's MANY MORE degrees below freezing. Clothes in locker, goggles on forehead, find lifeguard. Lifeguard #1: "You need your ID card." Back to locker room, retrieve ID card, past Lifeguard #1 who seems busy, find Lifeguard #2. Lifeguard #2: "Okay, let's find a lane." There are no empty lanes. Lifeguard #2 stops a random man at the end of his lap. "Can we share this lane with you? There's a student who needs to take the swim test." He says sure, then awkwardly starts zigzagging, presumably because he's not sure which half of the lane you want. You jump and start with freestyle. At the end of the second lap, you remember that freestyle is kind of tiring and switch to breaststroke. Four laps isn't too bad. As you walk out, you pass Lifeguard #1. He says "piece of cake, right?" and for some reason that makes you realize that you forgot to bring a change of clothes. NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! You stick your head under the hairdryer for a couple of minutes, then walk back to your dorm commando so that your swimsuit doesn't freeze solid to your skin. Congratulations! You passed the swim test. Four laps (and zero displacement) closer to graduation.   I'm writing this blog post sitting on my bed in my room at home in the sunny California Bay Area, where temperatures are above fifty degrees and the skies are probably going to be blue for the next three months. As this week comes to a close, so does MIT's week of finals. This freshman was lucky, and only had two finals (8.022 Electricity and Magnetism, and 18.03 Differential Equations). Since freshmen are on pass/no record, finals weren't too stressful--but still stressful enough. Nevertheless, despite the worry and uncertainty going around our class Facebook page, final grades are coming out, with little "P" for Passes appearing on transcripts, and most people had little to worry about no matter how unprepared they felt. Next semester, when the freshman class switches over to A/B/C/No Record (or, for those people like me pursuing sophomore standing, a normal letter-grading system), will be a little more interesting, but the way that MIT gives us first semester on Pass/No Record means that I think most people are ready to take it on without the training wheels. Both of my finals were on Monday, which meant I could spend all of Tuesday sleeping in/packing/unwinding, hop on a taxi at 5AM Wednesday morning for a 7:30 AM flight at Logan, and arrive home in California by noontime. I promptly called up some friends from high school to catch up over a solid In-N-Out burger, because (travesty of travesties) In-N-Out doesn't exist in Boston. I'll have two weeks in California before (exciting news!) flying out to Maryland over IAP (Independent Activities Period--in essence, MIT gives us the month of January to go adventuring before second semester starts in February) for an internship at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center. Being home is...odd. Being off school and having no pressing obligations is a little strange after a semester being firehosed at MIT, where you could have fun, but only at the expense of putting something else off until later. Being in my own room at home, though familiar, is also odd because I'm finding myself missing the feeling of having a lot of friends very close by, just a holler to the next room away. Going out to do things or hang out is especially strange because of the spread-out nature of the suburbs (also because of the somewhat disappointing fact that I'm not actually able to drive yet).  Visting my old high school was much the same way. The campus was just the same as before--plus or minus an extra building here, a parking lot there. I showed my AP Chemistry teacher my lab notebook from my UROP, and she replied with a chuckle, "I see your handwriting hasn't improved" (and she was totally right). When I was a high school senior and breaktime rolled around, alums coming back from college would often visit classrooms and answer questions from us high schoolers, nervous about college applications and even more nervous about the college experience itself. Now, being one of the visiting alums answering those questions felt especially odd--but they were interesting questions that many of you may be interested in as well. Here's a sampling: What's the worst part about being in college?I was asked this question twice, and answered it the same way both times. Being in college means being in a very rich, very active, and very busy environment, and there were many many many clubs I wished I could join, events I wished I could attend, projects I wished I could take on. But there are only 168 hours in a week, and I also need to eat and sleep. At some point, it's worth sitting down and actually calculating how many hours per week are accounted for by your classes and extracurriculars, and then asking the questions: "Am I getting everything important I want to get out of my time here?" "Which activities do I value more and get a greater reward from--hip-hop dancing or singing a cappella?" "Am I devoted enough to this activity that I'm willing to sacrifice schoolwork or academic success to pursue it?" Everything's a cost-benefit analysis when it comes to choosing activities in college, and it will definitely take a while to figure out which activities you want to stick with and which you'll have to set aside just because it's not really possible to juggle everything. What's dorm life like?It varies dorm to dorm. As for me, I'm sad to say I'm not as tight-knit with my neighbors as I should be, because living in Next House means I don't really spend that much time in my room. Usually I'll go to classes and stay on campus for meals at Maseeh, studying or working in the libraries with classmates, attending club or UROP meetings, or going to special events or talks. Next House being so far away means it's not really feasible to go back to my room to relax between meetings or classes. That said, it's easy to be that stranger that just uses their dorm room as a place to sleep and disappears for the rest of the day. It's just as easy to take a bit of effort and work late nights in the lounge with other people instead of in your room by yourself, or take some time to just say hello to people in passing, or even harmonize your shower-singing with your hallmates. That's all it takes to develop a good friendship with the people you live with. What's the best way to spend your senior spring/second semester senior year/last summer before college?Oho. Get in your college applications, and now what? Well...now's the time to try out things you didn't get to do before. Learn a new skill. Play with Arduinos. Go biking or hiking or both. Learn to cook. Read a book. Learn to drive (so you don't end up like me, 18 and unlicensed). See a bunch of movies.Here's the catch: DO IT WITH OTHER PEOPLE. These are people you won't get to see for a while, and now that you (presumably) don't have as much schoolwork-induced stress or obligation, you should spend that time developing those friendships with your high school friends. This is the junction where a lot of people you know may become lifelong friends and connections--or they may disappear into the past and you'll never talk to them again. It's up to you to decide which way you go. Even if you don't do anything and just want to sit around talking into the night--that's one of the best ways to get closer to people and ensure that you keep these friendships through college. What's your fashion inspiration?Okay, I'm only including this one because it was the first question asked of me when I got back. I suppose I'm dressing a little preppier--chalk it up to the East Coast influence, maybe? Regardless (for me at least), clothing and presentation have a huge influence on my own bearing and day-to-day life. Dressing better motivates me to work harder and be more confident and outspoken, whether that's answering questions in the classroom or greeting cashiers at the checkout. I also think I'm treated better when I'm dressed better--whether or not that's due to the appearance itself or to the way my attitude changes when I'm dressed up or just a case of really bad confirmation bias, it's a good feeling to have. For the nitty-gritty details about the fashion itself, uh...I refer you to Reddit.   That's all I've got for now. What are your questions? Shoot me an email ([email protected]/* <![CDATA[ */(function(){try{var s,a,i,j,r,c,l,b=document.getElementsByTagName("script");l=b[b.length-1].previousSibling;a=l.getAttribute('data-cfemail');if(a){s='';r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16);for(j=2;a.length-j;j+=2){c=parseInt(a.substr(j,2),16)^r;s+=String.fromCharCode(c);}s=document.createTextNode(s);l.parentNode.replaceChild(s,l);}}catch(e){}})();/* ]]> */) or comment below and I'll answer to the best of my limited one-semester freshman experience :) ~Allan Hi everyone, The Office of Admissions is mostly closed for the holidays and not accepting emails or answering phone calls. Many of us who read applications are taking a little break and resting up in preparation for all of your RA applications! We will be back on Monday, January 6. However, I know that those of you who were deferred or those of you still finishing up your RA applications in time for the January 1 deadline may still have a few questions. So lets see if I can answer some of the most common questions we get every year. For Deferred Students I was deferred. I will never get in RA, right? We will look at your application again and consider it in the context of the Regular Action period. In previous years, anywhere from 150-300 students were admitted in RA. It could be more or less this year; it depends on how the pool looks. But if you've been deferred you are now officially a member of the RA pool. Should I send in extra materials? You only need to send in your February Updates and Notes report, which will be available on MyMIT in January. On this report, you can provide us with your updated grades (your semester grades are very important, so keep working hard!) We will also include a text box for any other updates you'd like to provide (new awards, changes to your activities, etc...)  We will accept updates in other formats, including mail and email, but the Admissions Committee will primarily look to this report for your updates. Should I send in a whole new version of my application, or all new essays? No. You do not need to "improve" your application, or redo/edit/modify part or all of your application. You were deferred because your application was already strong enough to make you a contender in the Regular Action round. Let your application stand.   What about new test scores? If you are taking additional tests in December or January, you can include MIT as a score recipient and we will consider any new scores. Can I call admissions to find out why I was deferred? If you call in, we will not be able to tell you "the reason" why you were deferred, or "what needs to be improved," simply because things are much more complex than just one reason why you were deferred. In fact, there will likely be nothing at all missing or needing improvement in your application.   For RA students What is the application deadline? The deadline is January 1. This means you can click "submit" on your application any time on January 1 or before, but try not to wait until the last minute! What happens if some of my school forms come in past the deadline?  It is perfectly fine if, through no fault of your own, your school forms (e.g. teacher recommendations, secondary school report, transcript) come in after the January 1 deadline. We are much more understanding of and flexible with late documents from schools than with late documents from the applicant.Im taking tests in January, will these count? January is the last testing date that can be seen by the Admissions Committee (February will not be seen). If you will be taking the January test, just be sure to designate MIT to receive the scores. Please do not rush report your scores. We require either SAT Reasoning Test or ACT Plus Writing (or TOEFL). We also require 2 SAT Subject Tests (one in math, one in science). We only use the scores that make you look best, and we do abide by Score Choice.Is it too late to schedule an interview? The deadline to request an interview was December 10th, and has now passed. While highly recommended, the interview is not a required part of the application (and students whose interviews have been waived are at no disadvantage). You are welcome to request an interview from your Educational Counselor (EC) after the deadline, but do not expect that your request will be granted. If you have already interviewed with your EC, or have scheduled your interview for the near future, you are all set. Dont worry if your interview report has not yet appeared on your MyMIT Tracking. The deadline for ECs to submit their reports has not yet arrived. If you wish, you may now fill out the conducted interview form and we will be sure to get the interview report. I sent things in on time, but I dont see it on MyMIT tracking. What do I do?  The Records Office is working hard, but please recognize that processing can take 2 weeks. You do not need to worry at this time about documents that are not showing on MyMIT. Do not send a second copy of any document at this time. Also, you do not need to call MIT Admissions at this time to check on any such documents (there is a time for this later).Will using a fee waiver affect my application? We are happy to accept fee waivers for any student (foreign or domestic) who needs one. Using a fee waiver will not negatively impact your admission. You may use the SAT Fee Waiver, the NACAC Fee Waiver, or a letter from a school official detailing your situation. We will accept other fee waiver forms as well. I forgot something and I want to update my application, how do I do that? If you need to update your application after you submit it, the best way is the February Updates and Notes form.  On the last section of both Parts One and Two, there is a link that will allow you to preview your application as a PDF. This PDF is exactly how the admissions committee will see your application. Application tracking is available on MyMIT after you submit your Part 1. For this reason, I recommend submitting your Part 1 sooner rather than later, so that you can track your documents. I hope this is helpful. Best wishes as you finish and submit the application! And happy holidays!  Junior year pretty much ws a gigantic ride on the struggle bus for me...  but more on that later! This blog isn't about the lesson I learned this year or my feelings.... no, it's about my favorite class that I took this semester. 2.008 is a Design for Manufacturing class offered to Mechanical Engineering students. The course focuses on educating students about the design thinking and processes that can be used to mass manufacture products. As an engineer, this is really important because ultimately everything we design needs to be capable of being made somehow. 2.008 teaches us how to make it real.Of course, this is MIT, where we believe the best way to learn is to do. We apply what we learn in a big design project... where we make yo-yos!  Faced with the challenge of deciding what what we wanted our yoyo to look like, our team of 7 brave souls dug deep, deep into our childhood memories... and decided to make a yo-yo based on the 1996 movie Space Jam. For those of you who aren't familiar with the movie (sad day), the plot revolves around about Michael Jordan helping the Looney Toons in an epic, life-or-death basketball game.  To begin the design process, we hit the white board.  We moved to the computers to start working in Solidworks (a program used for modeling on the computer) and Mastercam (a software to program the machines to make molds)...  The LMP computer lab pretty much became my second home...Yep, I'm using 3 computers in this picture. But one of them was rendering something.... Then we manufactured some beautiful molds on the mill and lathe. Dave, one of the wonderful lab instructors, explaining how the lathe works to our team. The mill working hard to make our mold design. Look at all those flying chips! Dramatic mold photo. Looks so intense. One of our final molds. So shiny.Next we manufactured parts using the massive injection molding machine and thermoform machine. Dave, showing us all the buttons/functions of the injection molding machine. This machine heats up plastic pellets and then injects the molten plastic into the closed mold onto the right.  David '15, Rohun '15, and Dave measuring the rings that we manufactured to make sure they were the correct size. Steve '15 with the thermoform machine. This machine heats up sheets of plastics and then places them over a mold. The warm plastic is then sucked down on top of the mold to form into a shape. Our subtle basketball thermoform. Our first test of the body mold. Lots of flash (the excess plastic on the side), but we could fix that! Sarah '15, so excited about having our Bugs Bunny disks. All of the parts for all our yo-yos. Finally, we were able to assemble all our yo-yos!  Watching Space Jam and assembling all the yo-yos. May not have been the most efficient assembly line ever...  The finished yo-yo compared to the original design. Pretty much the same. All the yo-yos! (We had to make 50) To wrap up the class, we gave a short little poster presentation at the end. Now that's a good looking team. Not biased or anything...Overall, 2.008 is definitely one of the best classes that I took here. I learned a ton about the manufacturing process in a hands-on environment. Plus I got to spend a semester hanging out with some goofy goobers.  You can read more about our process/watch our awesome group video on our team blog here.Now, I hope you all are inspired to go connect with your childhood and watch Space Jam! You: Where are you from?Me: London.You: But you...you don't...you don't seem to have a British accent.Me: Correct. Let me explain! I was born in Singapore, had a Singaporean accent, then moved to London during the summer before fifth... read more  see complete archives  The new MIT Class of 2018 Facebook group is a warm, fuzzy place. Posts include "It's an honor and a privilege to be in here with you all," "I can't wait to meet you," and "I already feel a special love for all of you. Is that weird?" (No, it's not weird!) and virtual group hugs abound. It's also a very intimidating place. Scrolling through, my eyes are glossing over from all the acronyms (FRC, MOSTEC, RSI, ISEF, HSSRP, MITES, ...) There's a whole thread dedicated to sharing research experiences, with jargon like "dendrimer-encapsulated nanoparticles", "cardiac stem cells", "microbial contamination tracking", "mesenchymal stromal cells", "graphene oxide filters", and "radiation shields." Among the excitement and bubbliness, there's insecurity in comments like "I...have NO idea why I was accepted." Of the 80-ish responses to the poll question "How did you feel when you got accepted?" around 20% have said that "[MIT admissions] made a mistake." As a peer to these prefrosh, I'm stressed - and as a senior who knows what's ahead, I'm sad. In the fall of 2012, The Tech (MIT's student newspaper) conducted a survey on stress called "Under Pressure." You should take the time to check out all the results, but for this post I'm going to highlight one result in particular:  Some might call this modesty, but I would call this a warped sense of reality. The truth is - and I think it's pretty clear, both from living on this campus for 3.5 years and from looking through the results of this survey - that most MIT students respect and admire each other much more than they respect themselves. But what about that time y-no, no, that's not that great, not compared to what everyone else has done. But you're so passionate about-NO, no, EVERYONE here is passionate about something, that's not special. Have you done any research? WELLLL, nothing crazy like everyone else on this campus, but I have done a little bit of this and that. This Tech article came out hot on the heels of Lydia's blog post, Meltdown. In it, she describes insecurity and despair, partners to high-pressure environments like MIT. Her story broke my heart, and I was shocked and horrified when it emerged over the next few weeks just how many MIT undergraduates can relate to passages like this: Theres this feeling that no matter how hard you work, you can always be better, and as long as you can be better, youre not good enough. Youre a slacker, youre stupid...Theres stress and theres shame and theres insecurity. Theres something to giving everything and always falling short. Lydia also wrote that Eventually well walk out with a deep understanding of our fields, a fantastic tolerance for failure and late nights, and raised expectations for ourselves and for humankind. Someday, well look back on these four years as the best years of our lives and the foundations of the kinds of friendships that can only be formed with some suffering. At some point - I think it was freshman spring, when the workload really got crazy and I started pulling consecutive 4am bedtimes - I believed that there were good reasons for all of the stress and insecurity around me. I think I thought that all of this would make me tough, so it was worth suffering through. But I no longer think so. I've seen friends graduate still feeling like they didn't belong here. I have friends who are graduate students and post-docs -- and from them, I hear that it doesn't get better.  It's not worth it. There are better and healthier roads to success. Dear Class of 2018: Let me introduce you to Imposter's Syndrome. Chris described it in a blog post last spring. Essentially, Imposter's Syndrome is the belief that you don't belong, that you're a fraud, that you've been lucky so far and that all your successes are really nothing to be proud of. Imposter's Syndrome is rampant at MIT. Maybe you've already felt it, scrolling through the Facebook group and thinking "I DO NOT BELONG, I AM NOT WORTHY!" (honestly, it's hard for me to keep those feelings in check, getting to know you guys!) You will arrive at MIT at a time when the fight is underway -- but is still at the beginning stages. Student journalists and bloggers like Lydia are working to make us more aware of the phenomenon. Outgoing Chancellor Eric Grimson has called for changes to our culture -- to be less tough with each other and to celebrate achievements, where being super stressed does NOT count as an achievement. Student groups are tackling the issue from a Mental Health perspective.  I wonder if Imposter's Syndrome takes root right from the moment when prefrosh meet other prefrosh (and current MIT students) and don't know what to do with the fact that their classmates are all so incredibly accomplished. This Facebook group could be a great thing, or it could be a terrible thing: it could be a place where accomplishments and interests are celebrated and shared, or it could be a place where self-esteems come to die. Or both. Please make it the former, and do whatever you can to prevent the latter.  Don't feel the need to impress each other. You're already impressive to your peers, I promise, and frankly anyone who disagrees can go take a hike. When you describe your research and your interests, use language that anyone could understand: after all, your goal is to connect with your peers and help them understand your interests, not to create unnecessary disconnections.  Don't think of a peer's accomplishments as evidence of your lack thereof. Think about them as an addition to. You guys are building a class and a community. You don't need to apologize for what you haven't done: it's fine if you haven't done any research, it's fine if you don't play a musical instrument, it's fine if you've never participated in a math competition, it's fine if you aren't valedictorian, and - WOMP WOMP - it's fine if you don't like bubble tea* (those of you in the FB group know what I'm talking about). The point is that you bring something special to the table, even if you're not entirely sure what that something is.  *actually, I'm not sure about that one. Bubble tea is really good.  And know this: you deserve to be at MIT, you are and will be valued here, but it can and will be hard to remember that sometimes.  Recently, Chris linked me to this article. Hey guys! This is the year to eradicate Imposter's Syndrome. Speak up, Band together, Reach out. I know that you guys respect each other -- let that be the most prominent theme of your interactions. Take advantage of the fact that you're already getting to network with each other. This is a wonderful chance to begin fighting Imposter's Syndrome right from the beginning, and to set the right tone for your class: to celebrate accomplishments without undervaluing your own. Your challenge: make the Class of 2018 MIT's most self-confident. Trust me when I say that there are no imposters among you, because I helped cross-check your name against the list of admits when you sent a "Join Group" request. :) see complete archives  MIT Early Action admissions decisions for the Class of 2018 are now available at >>>      decisions.mit.edu      <<< You can log in using the same username and password that you use to log in to your MyMIT account. There are no interim screens, so you should be sure you are ready to receive your decision online before logging in to decisions.mit.edu. 6,820 students applied for early admission to MIT this year. This is a 4% increase from last year. Since most of these students were academically competitive and well-matched, this early action cycle was more difficult than ever for both our staff and our applicants. Of the 6,820 who applied we have admitted 612. We can't wait to welcome them to campus to join the 4,503 outstanding undergraduates who already call MIT home. Our Early Action admits hail from 49 states and 486 high schools. Though they all do different things - crafting and cartography, stargazing and sous vide, waltzing and welding - they are united by an academic record, a high caliber of character, and a strong match with MIT's mission to make the world a better place. We deferred 4538 applicants. These students will be considered anew in Regular Action. For more information on how our Early vs. Regular and deferral process works, you can read a previous post I've written on the subject. Because of the competitiveness of our pool, there were 1403 students to whom we are not able to offer admission this year. Through this process I have come to respect them all, but because of the highly selective nature of our process, we are certain we would not be able to admit them, and we wanted to let them know that as soon as possible. Please do not take this decision personally: if I have learned anything in this job, it is that selective admissions decisions are less a reflection of the applicant than a reflection of the institution. Please trust that we have done our compassionate best, and good luck with the rest of your applications this cycle. The balance of the applicants - 267 - either withdrew from our process before we issued decisions or had incomplete applications and were not able to be considered. We recognize it's a lot of effort for all of you to apply to MIT. It's an honor and a pleasure to do the work we do. And for all the fun we try to have on the blogs, we take our work very seriously. Again, congratulations to the newest members of the Class of 2018. I'll be closing comments on this post to focus the conversations on the open threads for admitted, deferred, and not admitted students. All best, everyone, and happy holidays.   IT HAPPENED! YOU GOT IN!      Go ahead and introduce yourselves :)  As you know, we had a very competitive Early Action applicant pool, and unfortunately we could not take all of them. If your decision was deferred, then we will reconsider your application anew in Regular Action.  We'll have some additional advice and instructions for Deferred students shortly. In the meantime, please feel free to use this forum to chat and KCCO.  There were many wonderful applicants for Early Action this year, which unfortunately means that we had to turn down a large number of incredible students. For those of you who fall into this category, this is an open forum for you to talk. We understand that this may be a difficult time for you, but we ask that you converse civilly and with the best of intentions, as that is the spirit of our process. *hug*   Dear EA applicant,      You're almost there. It's Friday/13/13, so if today is the 'unluckiest day', then maybe tomorrow is the luckiest? If not in the decision, then probably in something else, if you keep your mind open to it. It's 11:44 am right now and there are 24 hours and 30 minutes left before EA decisions. Given that the average length of a TED talk is 17.5 minutes, and that you're probably too excited to sleep tonight, that gives 84 TED talks you can watch in your rapidly diminishing waiting time. Not only will they keep your mind away from agonizing circular thoughts, you'll become more illuminated in 84 topics. That can be useful no matter where you go.                                                                                                              Bon voyage! Your internet friend,                                                                                                                                                 Anastassia TED Talks TED talks, for those unfamilar, are "riveting talks by remarkable people, free to the world." I started watching them in high school, and learned a lot more about current research, global problems, and technological initiatives than I ever did in class. They really opened up my mind to not only ways I can cause change on a large scale, but also within myself.  Some of my favorites have been: The game that can give you 10 extra years of life   How schools kill creativity My stroke of insight Have any of you guys watched these or other TED talks before? Here you can find the videos with the most views. Also the TED youtube channel.   TEDxCambridge I watched so many of these inspiring talks that I created a goal to have my own one day. Hmm.. what's a good first step but to watch them live? You can imagine my astonished elation when I learned that we were going to host a TED Conference right in our very own Kendall Square! Tickets were limited, so I had to fill out a short application asking who I was and why I wanted to attend. I ended up getting a discounted seat for only ~$20 in the outdoors section.  All photos courtesy of TEDxCambridge 2013 official photos page.   Psst: I'm in 3 of these photographs if you can find me. Yippee!   The outdoors section.  Where were the actual speakers? Inside the neighboring building, presenting and being filmed, while we got a live stream to the screen outside.  Afterwards, there was a reception of food, drink, and conversation with the speakers themselves! Who were the speakers? You can find all the videos from the TEDxCambridge event here.   Any feelings about TED talks, videos, learning, waiting, learning through video talks while waiting, any permutation thereof, or anything at all, please comment below! I read all of them.

Waiting is hard. Waiting is incredibly hard. Well, I guess that depends on how patient of a person you are, but I dont think Ive ever really been patient. When a big event looms, I mark its approach in a big red box. When I was but a tiny fetus, I remember counting down those nine long months to birth with a lot of snarling and kicking around. On the day I finally arrived on Earth, my patience had fast vanished, which explains the bawling, puking and hair-pulling antic I mentioned in my profile. My parents and siblings know all too well that when waiting for food at home, I turn into this hyperactive raging rhino. I check the fridge, stare around, pick up a tomato, laugh hard, put the tomato back, sigh, and shut the fridge. Two minutes later, I return to the fridge. Repeat activity. This continues on a loop until food arrives. Nine months ago, I was counting down the hours to the release of the Regular Action decisions, 3/14, 6:28pm in Boston (Pi Day, Tau Time). 3/14, 11:28pm in Nigeria. Someone on College Confidential had posted a link to a countdown timer. Several others had made posts about their excitements and fear and raw nervousness. Slices of optimism. Slices of pessimism. It really only added to the anxiety, but beneath that, there was a layer of community. Its interesting how you can bond over agonizing with people youve never seen before. Its probably part of the application experience. When the countdown timer ticked its way to less than 30 hours, my palpable fretting grew a notch. Naturally, I got my laptop out and wrote about how I felt. Hours later, I went to my high school where Pi Day was being celebrated. I spoke with friends, gushed over a cake with a pi-shaped icing, and got back home with slightly over six hours left on the countdown timer. What next? I watched an episode of Fringe. Then I watched Lion King Parts 1 and 2. Prior to that, Id watched both movies enough times to chant every line, but it still felt good watching them again, especially with my siblings. I still cringed at Mufasas death, and by the end of the second volume was a hair strand away from bawling about cruel fate and all such melancholy thoughts Lion King sometimes inspires. At the time, just about three hours were left. I went to the sitting room, where my parents and siblings were. They asked if I was alright. Sure, I said, managing a grin, taking a seat. We spoke about random things. Time really did speed up in those last three hours. My heart had settled, but it picked up again with five minutes to go. With a minute to go, I smiled at my mom. She smiled back. It was a warm, encouraging smile, and wordlessly, it told me Id be fine regardless of the outcome. I went into my room. I was alone. I picked up my I-Pad. I watched the timer count down the final ten seconds. The AC hummed. My heart thudded. Those two sounds were all I could hear. I told myself Id be fine. I went to decisions.mit.edu. Theres really nothing left to say that hasnt already been said before. Decisions are tough. We all know that. Amazing applicants get rejected. We all know that as well. A great deal is involved in the admissions process, and while trying to figure out behind-the-scenes of the committee, while trying to imagine if theyd frown at that one improperly used comma or brush it aside, its easy to get bogged down in the details from which fright and anxiety emanate, and lose sight of an overarching picture. What you see this coming weekend on a certain webpage will mark an important day in your memory, at least for a while. The moment before you see it, youre likely to reach a crescendo of anxiety. After that moment, the next instant shouldnt matter anymore to the extent that it super-inflates or super-deflates your self-esteem. If theres joy or disappointment, take it in and experience it for the time that you need to. Then go on. Theres a world of memories still waiting to be made. I know this is a tough time, but I promise you: youll be fine. Now, lets talk about silly things. Or anything at all. Ill start with tips for math and physics tests.   You: Where are you from?Me: London.You: But you...you don't...you don't seem to have a British accent.Me: Correct. Let me explain!

Projects are due, one of my friends slept for one hour last night, I have to submit a paper draft to my research advisor tonight, I e-mailed a paper to my music professor last night, and frankly everyone is just counting down the minutes until the day is over. For me, laughter is the best therapy (fortunately, it really doesn't take much to make me laugh hysterically). On the off-chance that it will also be therapeutic to you, here are a few things that have made me laugh over the past few days. Brace yourself for insight into my sense of humor: 1) This article. 2) My bff Sam B. '14's post on my Facebook wall, linking me to the first trailer for Sherlock Season 3 (EEEEEEE!!!!) and saying "Forget science. I'm dropping out to be a Benedict Cumberbatch fangirl." Sam is a brilliant physicist so cross your fingers that Sherlock Season 3 is really bad.  3) This blog post, which I re-read in order to answer an e-mail. Hysterical: - the line "I can't type endless text into my essays what's happening PLEASE HALP"  - rfong's 180-word fanfiction about m_quinn in the comments section - m_quinn's assertion that Chris Peterson might be "bashful" about something. Anything. 4) An invitation I received from my bff Cam T. '13, for his upcoming apartment-warming party. It read: "The Hodge Podge Lodge presents: Apartment | Warming Featuring:100% more chest hair."Real people" / four grown man-children.Other people from who knows whereFurniture by IKEA" I met Cam during blogger orientation my freshman year :) he drove me to IKEA so that I could get some furniture. Also, while we're at it, Cam's first blog post makes me laugh every time I read it. 5) This article.  6) This video. 7) A series of e-mails from my bff Sophie W. '14. Background: at the end of each semester, MIT undergraduates are flooded by e-mails reminding us to fill out subject evaluations. In the spring, Sophie forwarded the following e-mail to me: From: [email protected]/* <![CDATA[ */(function(){try{var s,a,i,j,r,c,l,b=document.getElementsByTagName("script");l=b[b.length-1].previousSibling;a=l.getAttribute('data-cfemail');if(a){s='';r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16);for(j=2;a.length-j;j+=2){c=parseInt(a.substr(j,2),16)^r;s+=String.fromCharCode(c);}s=document.createTextNode(s);l.parentNode.replaceChild(s,l);}}catch(e){}})();/* ]]> */ [[email protected]/* <![CDATA[ */(function(){try{var s,a,i,j,r,c,l,b=document.getElementsByTagName("script");l=b[b.length-1].previousSibling;a=l.getAttribute('data-cfemail');if(a){s='';r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16);for(j=2;a.length-j;j+=2){c=parseInt(a.substr(j,2),16)^r;s+=String.fromCharCode(c);}s=document.createTextNode(s);l.parentNode.replaceChild(s,l);}}catch(e){}})();/* ]]> */]Subject: on line course evaluations You are receiving this because you have not yet done your on line course eval for 9.00.

It's comforting to know that through all the vicissitudes of life, the ebbs and flows, the comings and goings and the stresses and dramatic changes and mood swings and changes in extracurricular commitments and global warming slowly destroying our planet -- Sophie will always find subject evaluation e-mail reminders really, really annoying. <3 8) Finally, this isn't funny at all, but for your continued entertainment here is a picture of a baby ocelot held by my boyfriend:  VacPac, an affordable battery-operated backpack refrigerator that could aid the transport of vaccines in remote areas. KoolPool, an educational and rehabilitative game designed to help developmentally disabled children. Elika, an artistic, aesthetic, foldable coffee table made of stainless steel and carbon fiber. Theyre all past products innovated by MIT Mechanical Engineering undergrads in a class known as 2.009: Product Engineering Processes. Earlier this week, 2.009 had its annual Final Presentation in which student-designed products were presented. -- I was in the Kresge Auditorium. People kept trickling in. Empty seats vanished. Music from a piano several feet above filled the room. Lights danced around, bouncing off ceilings and onto the stage. Needless to say, I was excited.  7:30PM; Program BeginsAnd how else would the presentation kick off but with...   ...a rendition of What Does the Fox Say by a live band playing on the upper levels. The crowd exploded into cheers and applauses while I sagely pondered the mysteries of the fox. After that, the course instructor David Wallace welcomed everyone, adding that his mom was watching and was pleased that hed shaved and cut his hair. Invisible nods of approval from mothers everywhere. The challenge in a nutshell: eight teams, each charged with making a new product on a budget of $6500 and a 3-month time constraint. It had to tie in somehow to the class theme for the semester: Be Well. Without further adosave enthusiastic clapping and a countdown the audience followed through with amazing energythe presentations began. Each presentation had to last a maximum of eight minutes, followed up by a 5-minute Q&A from the audience.  First up, Orange Team Presents: MIRACandace, the first speaker for orange team began by addressing the problem that had inspired the creation of MIRA: the lack of easy navigation systems for motorcyclists. One of several cyclists theyd talked to explained he had to pull up all the time to figure out directions. One possible solution: mount a GPS system onto the the motorcycle. Okay, except that this involves shifting focus between the system and the road repeatedly. A small experiment asking the audience to shift gazes between their right index fingers and the speaker proved how this could be impractical. Plus, cyclists have to be focused at all times, eyes on the road (so printed maps dont help either), ears picking up sounds (direction-giving earphones? Nah.) A possible solution to this: MIRA, a high-tech helmet attachment that projected navigation information onto the helmets visor, relayed over Bluetooth. Now, the cyclist can look ahead, seeing the road and the needed direction at the same time. We got to see a small demo.  Next, Michael explained the technical aspects of the product. MIRA works via a high-res LCD display. Light from this display passes through a calumet lens, from which parallel rays emerge. They bounce off a clear, plastic arm and into the eyes of the user.    We also got a brief overview of the different relevant parts of MIRA.   Purple Team Presents: EquiTempIn equestrian sports, success depends on the grace, strength and speed of the trained horses, each weighing about 1100 pounds, each exerting enormous forces on legs only about three inches in diameter. As wed expect, hours of training built up over time can lead to injuries. From the presentation, we learn that there is an 82% chance the horse will receive some kind of injury during its career. Several times, these arent detected early enough. The consequence, as one member of Purple Team put it: enormous emotional and financial loss. Sometimes, horses go into training without adequate warm-up. This often leads to tendon damage as a result of insufficient blood and oxygen flow. On the flip sidetheres always a flip sidein the absence of adequate cool down, the horses are unable to recover correctly, which can cause muscle convulsions. So where does EquiTemp come in? As Purple Team explained, a 3.5 degrees celsius rise in temperature of a horses lower leg signifies that it is sufficiently warmed up. EquiTemp resembles the splint boot horses often use in races, with a classic MIT twist: the teams splint boots consist of four thermal sensors that, when strapped around a horses leg, roughly match the position of the tendons closest to the leg. The sensors are able to flash an array of colored lights. Each color represents somethingthat the boot is incorrectly placed perhaps, that the horse is still getting warmed-up, that the horse is warmed-up and now ready to go into training, that the temperature of the horse is abnormal. There is also an additional strap worn by the horse-rider, an alert device that reports the colors of the boots attached to the horses legs, from which the rider can understand whats going on. Next, the team demonstrated how to strap the boots onto a horsewhich of course would require an actual horse. Right before my eyes, the cutest horse ever tenderly walks onstage. The audience gasps and claps. The horse, whose name is Pinkie, stares at us knowingly through beady black eyes    A soft silicon casing protects EquiTemps electronic components.  Trials and research with EquiTemp could establish some kind of threshold temperature indicative of injury to a horse.  Pinkie reminds me of a horse I rode a few years back along the shores of a beach in Nigeria. By rode, I mean I was forcibly scooped up and placed atop the saddle because I was too scared to touch the horse. Sensing my presence and fear, it began running. I began screaming. At first, it might have been a scream of joy. Until the horse began galloping toward the sea, the splashing waves. I began shrieking. Somehow, I survived that ordeal.  Red Team Presents: OllieA senior named Luke begins by explaining that the creation of Ollie was inspired by the consequences of dementia, which include agitation, confusion, loss of memory, anxiety, isolation and a sense of loss of purpose. However, the grounding effect and physical contact of certain animals often exert a calming and highly therapeutic effect on those afflicted. And hopefully, so does Ollie. Ollie is a social robot, and by no means a new concept, as Luke explains that universities like MIT, Stanford and Carnegie Mellon have already made extensive research into social robots, complete with prototypes. Social robots have been proven to have the same calming effect as animals, the upside to the former being that social robots are more constantly accessible. They can be around 24-7. Buttheres always a butsocial robots are typically expensivepast ones in the range of $6,000-$30,000and caregivers looking after people with dementia cannot afford to buy them. This is where Ollie comes in. Ollie was produced for five hundred dollars.  Ollie looks like a furry otter, and his features were chosen with several considerations in mind. His dimensions fit those of a new-born baby, evoking a feeling of care. His set of interactions are randomized, so that the same touch inspires new reactions from him. He waves, blinks gently, hugs fingers or hands, purrs, makes happy noises. A member of the team, Rick, demonstrated by rubbing Ollies chest, prompting him to purr. That gentle sound melted ice glaciers and the hearts of the audience. The idea, Rick explains, is that Ollie can be used at homes. Caregivers can hand Ollie to their loved ones, either in everyday situations or when they get scared and confused to help calm and sooth them. This explanation is followed by a different gentle sound from Ollie. Helplessly, the audience croons with delight. Turns out the otters eyes begin drooping as though hes about to sleep, when his batteries get low. To design Ollie, the red team worked with three organizationsthe Cambridge Rehabilitation and Nursing Center, the German Center for Extended Care and the MIT AgeLab. Inside Ollie are custom-printed circuit boards that possess the motor drivers and touch sensors. External stimuli gets translated to Ollies brain, which sends the appropriate response to the hardware components.  Ollie's waterproof interior The arms above are cast with silicon and are attached to Ollies shoulder joints alongside which filament wires run. His fur is removable and washable, which sounded a bit frightening at first, much like ripping off human skin to toss into a laundry machine, but practicality necessitates this. Overall, the team believes Ollie has great potential, telling us in conclusion: hes otterly adorable.  Pink Team Presents: VerdaOn the southern edge of Boston is the neighborhood of Mattapan. Members of the pink team met with the Mattapan Food and Fitness Coalition (MFFC) while trying to come up with a product. They discovered a challenge the residents of Mattapan faced. In a one-mile radius of Cambridge, we can expect about forty grocery stores. In Mattapan, this number falls drastically to six. Consequently, MFFC operates a mobile farm stand during the summer to help with the circulation of groceries. This stand follows a looping route that starts at Mattapan Square, proceeds beyond a park, circles round a senior residence and heads back to the square.  However, it is quite heavy, so that at the end of a loop, the stand operator (typically a young adult over sixteen) already feels drained, the physical equivalent of an MIT students mind after a heavy-duty problem set.  This is where Verda comes in.  Verda is lightweight and easily maneuverable, capable of navigating tricky roads with a turn radius comparable to a small cars. By itself, Verda weighs 100lbs, and can easily support an additional 250lbs. A front hinge makes it easily attachable and detachable to and from most bikes. An attached string activates a pulling mechanism, allowing Verda to rise to a height compatible with its operators.  The overhead canopy is made of a lightweight, waterproof fabric, and the colored, red- and yellow-compartmental bins are sloped in a way to keep the stand contents out of the reach of curious, hand-stretching little kids, while maintaining visibility. Feast your eyes little ones, but thou shall not touch. Unless thou is an adult or super-tall in which case thou can touch. Beneath the compartments are additional storage spaces where more groceries can be stored. From one side of Verda, a table of sorts can extend outward, allowing access to a cashbox, a hanging scale and a stool. MFFC has already expressed excitement over Verda, and following the presentation, Pink Team explained that it would denote a prototype unit of Verda to MFFC.  After Pink Teams presentation, there is a very cool clip of Doctor Oz encouraging 2.009 students to pursue their dreams to their fullest extent.  He assures them that, aside from getting his daughters to listen to him, they can do anything! They cheer excitedly.   Green Team Presents: PoseidonThe Green Team introduces Poseidon as a device that gives back real-time feedback by shining a laser point at the bottom of the pool. This laser moves at the swimmers desired speed.  Its designed with triathletes in mind because their excellence hinges on their ability to maintain speed and stamina over grueling distances. The team explains that Poseidon fills in a gap in the exercise market by being the swim-analog for treadmills and stationery bikes.  On Poseidon, you can input different calibrations such as the length of the pool, its depth at both ends and the time you want the laser to traverse the pool for, essentially defining the pace. As usual, theres a demonstration.  Were assured that the product-tester pictured above has used the device before, as evidenced by his broad shoulders and tight abs.  Attached to a metal plate on the back of Poseidon are magnetic suction cups connected with rotating linkages. This enables the device to fit onto the tiles of varying pool walls.  During the demonstration, we observe the laser point swimming along the bottom of the water according to a calibrated pace. Cheers erupt. As were informed, the laser is emitted by an FDA-approved diode, and is safe. This laser diode is aimed at a mirror mounted to the shaft of a galvanometer. The variable angular speed of the galvanometer translates into the laser dots constant linear pace.  Poseidon can run for 7 hours continuously before requiring a recharge. It floats on water and is, as would be expected, waterproof.  Silver Team Presents: BitDexMachine Shops all over the United States receive a high influx of super-busy customers. Having passed and glanced at one or two of these on my way to class at MIT, I can attest to the resulting consequence of drill bits and sawdust piling up alongside other similar sundries. In addition, there are over four hundred different classifications of bits, the difference in sizes between several pairs of them being less than a thousandth of an inch. As a result, trying to classify these different bit sizes can be time-consuming and error-prone. The two preexisting classification methods have accuracy ranges of 60%-85% and take between 8-20 seconds, with the Murphys-Law twist that the more accurate method takes more time. How does Silver Teams BitDex measure up?  Thats BitDex up there. It classifies drill bits in four seconds and with 95% accuracy, as prior tests with it show. We saw a briefi.e. four-seconddemonstration. A bit was inserted into the circular hole on the right, and then placed on the holder in the middle. A button was pushed. Four seconds later, the bit classification was displayed. Seeing as mistakes in classification cost a lower bound of about $250 per mistake, BitDex has great cost-saving potential. How does it work? After the magic button is pushed, the following happens. An internal LED light system provides a high contrast background for the drill bit. Elsewhere, a photo-sensor and a lens form an optical system that produces the same focal length, through which the diameter can be measured.  A projection of the drill bit against the high-contrast background is captured, and a measurement is taken along its edge.  A microcontroller operates the camera and measures the diameter.  The pixels picked up by the camera are compared against a lookup table in the microcontroller.  The information picked up is what gets displayed on the BitDex screen.   Blue Team Presents: San-XBlue Team kicked off with a horror story its product could hopefully fight against. Wrestling teams dominate thousands of high schools and colleges in the US, which involves a lot of skin contact with wrestling mats. This feeds onto the mat several happy microorganisms, each waiting to cause harm. Several news report have broken out in the past about skin diseases contractible from wrestling mats.  I know; not pretty. As the team points out, repeated exposure leads to the troubling data indicating that wrestlers are sixteen times more likely than other athletes to contract skin infections. The traditional method of cleaning up these mats involves a mop, a bucket and a lot of time. The method Blue Team came up with? San-X: The first fully integrated steam- and UV-machine optimized for cleaning wrestling mats.  San-Xs UV light breaks down the molecular bonds in the organisms DNA, and is contained in seven bulbs running along the underside length of the machine.  However, UV does not take care of the remnant sweat and dust particles, but steam does. Being abundant and quick to evaporate, it is a viable solution, one San-X emits by heating water placed in its cylindrical container.  The water passes through a filter before going into the heating unit pictured above. The unit is equipped with a thermofuse and a switch. Polycarbonate prevents overheating. The resulting steam passes through evenly spaced channels at the bottom of the machine and through a microfiber surface onto the mat. San-X also has an indicator bar on its surface that relays to its user that he or she is moving at the correct or incorrect pace required for optimal steam or UV exposure.  Finally, Yellow Team Presents: GlowJeff Carothers of Yellow Team opens up the presentation with a pun on his teams product, saying, Hows it glowing? to resounding laughter. Were excited to introduce Glow, he says. Your own private yoga instructor. Glow is a yoga mat with surface-embedded LED displays to show users where to place their hands and feet. It also has pressure-sensors that can sense right or wrong yoga form, as well as weight distribution. Someone named John came up to demonstrate. A member of the audience wolf-whistled. Glow is connected to a computer, in which a Glow software application comes on, asking for specific details like name and height. It also allows users to track their progress over time.  After users have filled in specific details, they can select a pose or a sequence of poses that they would like to go through. After the selection, a short clip on the computer shows an instructor moving to perform the starting pose. At the same instant, colored LED lights on the electronic mat show users where to place their hand and feet, so that they align themselves shortly following the instructors action.  As we can see, theres a palpable discrepancy between both pictures above. The demonstrators weight distribution does not match the instructors. Glow senses this, and the LED lights turn red, prompting John to redistribute his body weight without moving away from the lights. At the correct orientation, the mat glows green, indicating a good match. Users can perform 20 to 45 minutes worth of sessions through the application, after which it can tell them what poses they did well on, and what poses could use some improvement.  As shown above, Glow possesses a layered architecture. The bottom layer is made of PVC foam identical to the foam used in a regular yoga mat. Above this is a second layer, which is essentially a grid of pressure sensors that detect and relay the hand and feet weight distribution of a user during a certain pose. It then compares these readings to what the proper pose-specific readings should be, through which it gives feedback. This feedback of course is through the LED lights, which lie in parallel strips atop the pressure sensors. Layered over this is silicone which prevents users from feeling the LED strips when they step on the mat, giving it the same natural feel as a regular yoga mat while also protecting the electronic components. The final top layer, like the bottom, is made of PVC foam.  After each presentation was a brief Q&A session in which members of the audience asked questions about the products. A few valid concerns or deficiencies were usually brought up and addressed, as well as possible extensions that could be made. The presentations themselves, some hiccups aside, were smoothly delivered and immensely impressive. This post doesnt capture every detail of the productsparticularly the financial aspectsbut these were also highlighted in the presentation. After the final presentation, the students showed their appreciation of their professor, David Wallace by presenting him with a picture of himself in a superhero-costume and a bullhorn.  One of them said, He has turned 2.009 into an unparalleled experience for Mechanical Engineering students at MIT, and we cannot thank him enough for everything hes done for us. While seating in Kresge, transfixed to the amazing students up on stage, I momentarily forgot that they were students. For a moment, they seemed larger than life. Its a truly amazing phenomenon that every fall semester, the students of 2.009 are able to come together, brainstorm and produce these innovations, these products that werent around four months ago, these products that in some way impact their environment. To celebrate them, Kresge bellowed, sending explosions of confetti raining over all of us. We clapped. We clapped hard.  How cool is 2.009? Fridays are sneaky. Theoretically, as the last day of the week and the only thing standing between you and two glorious days of freedom and relaxation, Friday is the greatest day of the week. But as the last day of the week, Friday can also be the slowest and the longest day of all the weekdays. Sure, Monday is a pain. Tuesday is kind of meh. Wednesday at least has the benefit of being in the middle of the week for those of us who enjoy the simple pleasures of symmetry. And Thursday rhymes with spurs-day. Friday, on the other hand, somehow finds a way to wedge itself between unicorns-and-narwhals awesomeness and my-face-is-melting-from-lack-of-sleep exhaustion. I like to dabble in the ancient and storied art of The Doodle, so I thought Id try to capture my last three Fridays and compile them in a catalogue of sorts here. I guess Fridays are whatever you make of them, so without further ado, here are my last three creations. Friday, November 22nd  Waking up on Fridays involves quite a few glassy-eyed stares and jellified limbs. My sleep deficit starts accumulating on Monday, so by the time the alarm declares that its 9AM on a chilly Friday morning, I want nothing more than to just burrow under the covers and go back to sleep. But there is learning to be done! So I make a mental note to get extra sleep over the weekend and head off to class. Do you ever get the feeling that Fridays are a lot like noodle-shaped dragon fauns? Fridays are my longest day. Noodle-shaped dragon fauns are pretty long. I have to fight off Friday fatigue with midday snacks and subtle face slaps. The most effective way to fight off noodle-shaped dragon fauns is with midday snacks and subtle face slaps. The similarities are endless. Once classes ended, I ate a quick lunch and hurried off to my writing tutor meeting where we discussed philosophical writings and probed the inner workings of my brain. As Ive mentioned before, Im enrolled in 24.09 Minds and Machines, a communication intensive HASS class (CI-H), which means essay writing fun for an entire semester! Because it is a writing based class, we have two designated writing tutors that are available to help us with all our writing questions and needs. I cant comment on any other CI-H classes, but the tutors for 24.09 were extremely nice and willing to help out whenever I had any questions. After my writing meeting, I skipped over to the tennis courts to swing my racket around for a bit. This drawing accurately depicts my graceful movements on the tennis court. They call me Krystal Antelope Legs Lai. Well, at least they should. While the tennis season is technically over, we still have optional off-season conditioning and practice in the bubble, MITs very own indoor tennis court facility shaped like a giant half-marshmallow. I know spring season is just around the corner, but I miss our team shenanigans already. Wow, is this a picture of Krystal happily devouring dorm dining hall food? No. This is a picture of Krystal happily devouring a delicious green papaya salad that she bought at Thaitation for dinner. The puniness just blows me away. My friends and I had journeyed across the Harvard Bridge into Boston to visit the Guitar Center where we were scoping out different synthesizer models (more on this in a later post). We swung by the Thai restaurant on a whim. Like all the other freshmen at Maseeh, we are on the oft-reviled 19 meal plan. But we were already out and the siren song of Thai food was too delicious to resist. To finish off my Friday, I went to the Chorallaries Suit & Tie concert. Things the Chorallaries are not: 1) four human bodies fused together at the torso 2) bad singers. Things the Chorallaries most certainly are: 1) a wonderful student a cappella group 2) loveably hilarious performers 3) master skit writers 4) amazing singers. It seems like theres a student performance every week, from a cappella concerts, to dance shows, to theater pieces. I walked out of the lecture room where they were performing with a huge smile on my face and another mental note to go to more student performances in the future. Friday, November 29th  Thanksgiving break went by in a snap. Thankfully, it was a snap filled with food, family, and some long awaited relaxation. My parents and sister flew in to Boston for the four day weekend and I was really excited to see them and show them around the campus that I like to call home now. I probably spent about 78% of the break in bed and most definitely ate my weight in turkey and chocolates. It was nice to just talk about life and the universe instead of vector cross products and tumor suppressor genes. Friday, December 6th  For the entire first week of December, I somehow managed to pull myself out of bed at 6:30AM and trek over to Massachusetts General Hospital to shadow one of the doctors there. I'm basically a doctor now. Having a campus in Cambridge right next to Boston, MIT has the advantage of being close to quite a few major hospitals (i.e. MGH, Boston Childrens Hospital, Tufts Medical Center). Im a pre-med so anything related to medicine gets me excited. Thats probably why I managed to wake up two and a half hours earlier than usual without collapsing into a sleep-deprived puddle of Krystal half way through the day. A poem by Krystal Lai Meetings in stools, meetings in chairs.Meetings in rooms, meetings upstairs.Literally. Meetings everywhere. I watched The Lives of Others for the first time while devouring a bag of cinnamon sugar pita chips. Life was good. There is a media room in the basement of Maseeh filled with sofas, epically sized bean bags, and a large screen upon which any movie of your choosing can be projected. Maseeh runs film screenings once every two weeks for the entire dorm and this weeks movie was an academy award winning German film. No spoilers or anything, but I thought the ending was pretty great. What winter night is complete without some gingerbread wizardry? This masterpiece is an artists rendition of the Statue of Liberty that Ellie 17 and I created out of candy parts, graham crackers, icing (lots and lots of icing), and squishy marshmallows. SaveTFP, an MIT student organization dedicated to alleviating the stresses of school work and campus life, is always hosting awesome events like gingerbread house making, waffle topping, or video game playing nights where students can just unwind. Sometimes the work can really pile up and its nice to know that theres an entire group of people out there making sure the stress wrinkles on your forehead don't become permanent. -End of Catalogue- I only have one more Friday left in my first semester at MIT and only one more day of actual classes tomorrow. The days slip by so quickly that it feels like before long, I'll be graduating, buying a house, and knitting grandma sweaters on my front porch. For now, I'll try not to get too far ahead of myself and instead just enjoy every Friday that I'm lucky enough to spend here. Happy Holidays! P.S. For all of you waiting with bated breath, good luck on EA decisions! You: Where are you from?Me: London.You: But you...you don't...you don't seem to have a British accent.Me: Correct. Let me explain! I was born in Singapore, had a Singaporean accent, then moved to London during the summer before fifth... read more  see complete archives  Hey all! Time for another round of Q&A. A few general comments: Phew. Okay. I think that's it. Moving onto e-mails from you all -- Z. H. asked, Do you read the essays? The answer is no, I have no input whatsoever on the admissions process. NONE! - A.S. said, I just learned that my AP Calculus AB grade for my first semester is not a B+, but a C+. My teacher hadn't properly input my final exam score into the school's grading system... I'd love to go to MIT. I want to major in Economics, and I'd love to attend a school that is strongly scientific and result-oriented. I had a good application and a fantastic interview, but I think I've just ruined my chances. I truly empathize with your situation in Quantum II class. I hope that things even out for you soon. I said, Thanks for your message. I'm sorry to hear about what happened in AP Calc. Sometimes when I'm bummed out about something, I try to imagine what it will look like to me a few years down the road. You may look back and think "wow, that C+ really ruined everything" - alternatively, you might look back and think "wow, you know, I'm really glad I got that C+, because it motivated me to put in a bunch of work to fill in the gaps in my mathematical background, and I'm way better off for it." How you feel down the road is up to you now :) But yeah - I do empathize with you. I'm a little freaked out that it may have ruined my grad school chances, but I'm confident that I'm a good applicant in other respects and I'm sure things will work out.  A.S. replied, Based on what I've read on the MIT blog, you're crazy awesome. Presumably, graduate schools want to admit crazy awesome people, so obviously you should get in. I hope you get into your favorite school so that you're happy, but if not, it's quite literally their loss. On the calculus front, my teacher agreed to raise my grade to a B on the condition that I get a B or higher by the end of the second semester. We both agreed that such a thing was very feasible--I always do better in semester 2. I'll be going to more study sessions and doing more practice problems, as well. Hardly the most exciting of plans, but it's nice to have an outline for the battle to come. Thanks, bro. Battle on! - V. M. asked, Over here at my school, we aren't taught any foreign language. The languages taught here are English, Hindi and Malayalam of which English is my first language and Hindi my second. So I would I be able to fulfill that requirement by learning Hindi? Unfortunately I don't know anything about that -- best to direct e-mails like that to the admissions office. - M. B. said, I spoke with some counselors at the community college I'm attending for the next two years in place of my high school junior and senior years...In a totally unexpected turn of events, I will actually finish with Higher Level Calculus I, II, and III as well as Physics based Calculus I, II, and III, Differential Equations, linear Algebra, and a LOT of coding experience, which is particularly important to me. I am SO excited that I get to take these classes but I worry that I won't be able to handle it or that I'll overload myself and have a mental breakdown?! Alternatively, I worry I'll struggle too much and inherently have a suffering GPA because I took classes that I wasn't prepared for. The counselors at the college assure me that by the end of this year I will have had all the pre-college math I need in order to do well in Calculus 1, but I suppose some amount of uncertainty is natural on my part. I replied, The community college courses sound awesome! I sympathize with the fear of, you know, ruining yourself by taking more than you can handle. Let me pass on some advice that I got from Cathy Modica, the MIT Physics academic administrator, who has been around for a while and has seen a lot of undergrads come and go. She told me that she always encourages students to challenge themselves - in other words, when there's a "should I take this class? I'm worried that it'll be too hard" she encourages them to decide "yes!", because even if you don't get an A+ you learn a lot by stretching yourself - and even surprise yourself by how much you're able to take on. That said, if you really find that you're WAY out of your depth - so much so that you're not going to learn - then pull out. I imagine that that will continue to be an option. So I'd say go for it! Also, with those classes, you will be very well prepared for MIT :) - Q. D. (a transfer applicant from California) asked, What kind of research opportunities does MIT provide for its undergraduate Physics students?Why did you choose to major in Physics?Is the transfer admission process handled by the same people who deal with freshmen admission?Why did you go to MIT? What's bad about MIT? I replied (frantically, from an airport), Research opportunities: all kinds, from beginner stuff (simple coding, electronics, experimental stuff) to more advanced theoretical work for those with the requisite coursework.Why I chose physics: I liked my classes in physics, and the department here is absolutely fabulous. The professors are very invested in the undergraduates (which is not the norm for high-quality research institutions!) which to me is the most important thing. Also, there are great opportunities for doing research.Transfer admissions: I actually don't know anything about that, I'm sorry... I'm actually not 100% sure why I went to MIT - it was kind of a gut thing. I showed up for CPW, loved it. I also had been reading the blogs for many years, and felt comfortable with the place. There are the obvious things like GREAT UNDERGRAD RESEARCH OPPORTUNITIES! and SMART PEOPLE! etc, but in the end I think it was a feeling that I would be happy here - and certainly, I've had a good time. That said, there have been very rough patches. The atmosphere isn't "competitive", exactly, and people are good about working together, but every individual is incredibly competitive with him or herself. We're all used to being the best, I guess, so we can be very hard on ourselves. I'd say that student low self-confidence and high self-imposed pressure is the worst thing about this place. It makes for kind of a stressful environment. - U. V. asked, Any tips on writing? I replied, Read a lot of good writing, and write a lot. - P. G. from India asked, I have sent in all my college applications before the deadline, and am now enduring the nerve-wracking period of waiting for the decisions. While my MIT admissions interview has been waived (owing to a lack of interviewers in my area), I do have upcoming interviews for some other schools.Would you have any suggestions regarding the college interview? It would certainly help a lot. Maybe a few general guidelines. I replied, Congratulations on having submitted all your apps! Advice on the interviews: if these are US schools (interviews work differently in other countries) then I would suggest thinking of it like any conversation with an interesting person. You want to find out about this person (and MIT!) but also want to communicate certain things about yourself. Relax, and let it be casual. It helped me to think in advance about the kinds of questions they might ask (what my interests are, what I do for fun, etc) so that I could have answers prepared - but I didn't rehearse anything. - N. L. asked, I have an equal passion for both the humanities and science/math fields. However,I am stronger in the humanities. Math and science are a challenge for me. I often stay after school to get tutoring from my teachers/other students. I was wondering what the average class size at MIT is. Also, are the professors available to help students one on one after class? I replied, I also have equal passions for the humanities and science/math fields - and I'm also stronger in the humanities. Unfortunately, average class sizes at MIT are very big, for beginner (freshman) subjects...often hundreds of students. As you get more advanced and more specialized, class sizes get much smaller. That said, professors and Teaching Assistants are available to help - at least in the physics department, they're very easy to get in touch with and reach out to. Not necessarily directly after class, but each has a special set of office hours when you can drop by and get help. N. L. wrote back, Regarding the beginner freshman classes, I was wondering how how quickly material in class is covered. In my AP physics class we usually learn the whole chapter within a few days. I'm a slower learner who needs lots of reinforcement before grasping a concept and the fast pace we've been going at has been a struggle for me to keep up with. I wrote back, It really depends on the version of the freshman class. For intro physics mechanics, for example, there are multiple versions: 8.01L, 8.01, and 8.012, which cover the topic at wildly different levels of rigor and pace. I also need a lot of reinforcement to grasp a concept, and classes here have been difficult for me. Granted, there is always help available if you ask for it. It's worth bearing in mind that you can't spend all your time getting extra help - and if you always need extra help, in all your classes, this probably isn't the right place for you, or you haven't picked the right level / number of classes. It's really difficult to give you advice on your situation, because I haven't taken your AP physics class, so I can't really compare the pace to the pace of an MIT class. It is certainly true that if you don't enjoy the challenge, you will probably not enjoy MIT classes...they're not easy for anyone. - A. J. asked, Is coding really required for physicists? I replied, Yes, coding is definitely required for physicists! - I. S. asked, Anyway, because it is very competitive to get into schools such as MIT, I understand that it is important to do what is enjoyable in school in terms of both academics and extracurriculars. I really enjoy doing cross country and robotics...but I haven't really won major awards in high school - I've won some awards in cross country, but in terms of academics, I haven't won any departmental awards. Though I have been in the math club, I haven't won gold medals or any other type of recognition in a competition. However, I feel that I would still be able to write well about what I enjoy doing in my college applications. Would my lack of qualifications in awards be taken negatively by schools such as MIT? Or would it depend on the application as a whole (as they are evaluated "holistically")? I really enjoyed the learning environment of the schools I visited, but sometimes, I worry that the admissions officers might question my qualifications because of my lack of awards/recognitions. I replied, You're right; it is (outrageously) competitive to get into schools like MIT nowadays. So much so that acceptance is really down to luck, and whether you can somehow distinguish yourself from the zillions of other applicants. "Distinguish" can mean "win every math award ever offered by the United States of America" or "win one gold medal per day since birth" - and I have classmates that fall into that category. However, it can also mean having a particularly thoughtful, kind character, which shines through on your application. It can mean taking a handful of AP classes, despite not going to a school that offers *any* AP classes. Basically, the goal of the admissions office is to identify applicants who will succeed here, and demonstrating the *potential* to succeed is just as important as having already succeeded. In other words, showing that you're the kind of person who *will* do awesome things here (who is brave, resourceful, etc) is as important - if not more important - than being able to list 20 awards that you've won. I'm so (SO) glad to hear that you've been doing activities that you enjoy. Too many high schoolers think that the key to college admissions success is doing activities that will look good on their application - and they ignore what they are naturally drawn to doing. I don't know you very well, but I can tell you that MIT will absolutely evaluate your application holistically, and that a laundry list of awards is NOT necessary for admission. - A. T. asked, I don't know why am I telling you all this and I'm sorry to ramble on this way but I've always wanted to go to college at MIT ever since I've known about the place; it's just that I feel I haven't done anything significant in the past 17 years of my life to be thought of as good enough to attend MIT...I was hoping you could tell me what does it really take to get in and whether or not I still have a shot at getting in. I replied, First of all, saying that you haven't done anything significant in 17 years doesn't make much sense. You've definitely done things that were important to your family, your friends. Sure, maybe you've never been on the news - but most of us haven't. The phrase "good enough to attend MIT" also doesn't make much sense...we get admitted here because we're a good fit, and that can mean a lot of different things. To get in, it takes a demonstration that you will thrive here. That you will be able to succeed academically AND socially. I don't know you very well, so I have no sense at all for whether that would be true for you. If you think you would be a good fit, then apply, and see what happens!   - S. S. asked, I've had a fascination with space, physics, and math and science in general since I was small, and I think I would probably like to pursue a career in a related field. I don't think that I'm interested in a teaching/professorship position though. I know that there must be research positions out there but I don't know much about them, and generally when I look for information on jobs in these fields I find a lot of results about academia. Do you think that you could tell me a little more about career options besides tech/engineering available for someone interested in studying the sciences? I replied, There are definitely options other than teaching or being in academia. For example, I work at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory, which is an NSF-funded institution and is made up of staff scientists, not professors. I really like the environment, and I'd be happy to tell you more about it if you have particular questions. Other similar places include national labs, like the Sandia National Laboratories in New Mexico, or the Los Alamos National Labs. These places tend to do a lot of defense-related work, but they have cognitive science departments and definitely hire a lot of physicists. There are also communities of researchers at (some) museums.  S. S. responded, I think my parents are a little concerned that if I major in a pure science like physics or even chemistry, rather than something with more obvious applications (engineering or something similar) that I will have a harder time finding a job. Is it very hard to find work with a physics degree? Also, do you kind of need to have a Ph.D or will a bachelors or a masters get you a good job? If I were to pursue a Ph.D or grad school, are there similar amounts of financial aid available? My parents and I are probably going to have enough trouble with just paying for the bachelors and I don't know how expensive grad school is. Do you know much about how jobs and research opportunities in Europe compare to those in the U.S.? Are there similar opportunities available? I heard or read somewhere that in some of the bigger, more basic classes at MIT, you ended up "teaching yourself" a lot of the material, rather than it being taught to you. I took the majority of my high school classes online through community colleges so I'm no stranger to that learning method but I was curious if you agreed that that was the case. Also, are there a lot of physics majors at MIT? And as a blogger, do you get a lot of emails from random people such as myself? I replied, - I guess it depends on what kind of job you're hoping to have. Actually, a lot of companies (for example, financial institutions) really like hiring people with physics degrees! And you definitely don't need a Ph.D. in physics to get a good job -- you really need a Ph.D. for academia (research, teaching at the college level, etc.) There are some good resources online; the American Physical Society has a thing about careers for physicists in the US. In any case, once you get to college, you will have the opportunity to talk about this stuff in more detail with company representatives, professors, and upperclassmen, before you have to make a decision about a major. So you have plenty of time, but it's good to start doing some research now!- You actually don't have to pay for grad school in physics -- YOU get paid! It's considered a full-time job (and, really, it is -- you're working all the time.) You're paid (albeit not very much) to do research :)- Europe: depends what you want to do! I know that in my particular field (astronomy) there are a lot of really strong research institutions in Europe. Not sure about other areas of physics.- For me, learning in college has certainly required more independence than learning in High School did. That's because I went to a really small school, so had a lot of guaranteed interactions with teachers. If a student didn't do his/her homework, the teacher intervened and tried to work with the situation. On the other hand, college classes are so much bigger that you often slip by being anonymous -- if you fall behind, there won't necessarily be someone to push you and make you turn in your homework on time. All that said, there are a lot of resources available for people with enough initiative to take them; at MIT in particular, I've found the professors to be REALLY helpful -- you just have to make a point to get in touch with them, and take advantage of the available resources!- There are, relatively, quite a lot of physics majors at MIT. I think that in a given year (~1000) there are about 80 physics majors. Departments like computer science/electrical engineering, and mechanical engineering, are a lot bigger though.- Depends what you mean by "a lot" :) I usually get a couple of e-mails a week.

Aside from a cappella, dance is another big thing at MIT.  And the largest dance group on campus is Dance Troupe, a student-run group that puts on a show every semester.  Previous shows have had variously amusing/confusing names like 50 Shades of Plie and #DTMF.  This year's fall show? DTWERK. (if you don't know what twerking is, I direct you to the Oxford Online Dictionary.  Or maybe innocence is bliss?) I think the variety of dances speaks to the diversity of MIT's student body.  The show ran the gamut from poppy R&B...  ...to ballet-ish...  ...to an Indian folk dance by guest group Bhangra...   ...to tap dancing...  ...to a rendition of Anna Kendrick's Cups...  ...and more.

Load rounds into magazine. Insert magazine. Release the bolt. Grip as in a firm handshake. Inhale, raise arm. Exhale a little, press gently on the trigger until you meet resistance, lower arm to target. Focus on the front sight. Without taking your focus off that front sight, gently press harder, ignore the BANG!, pull the trigger all the way back and keep sight on target even though the bullet is already long gone. Technically, the hardest part is keeping your arm steady, if you're like me and have almost no muscles above your hips. It's no surprise, then, that Mike Conti (the MIT PE pistol instructor) tells his classes that shooting is 90% mental and 10% technical. Here are four life lessons from pistol class, typed up (ironically) while I skip pistol class to fly to Los Angeles (don't worry, Mike is cool with it) --  1. ReMOVE the magazine. RePLACE the magazine. Each class, Mike verbally directs our warm-up routine: "Remove the magazine. Replace the magazine." He uses the same intonation and inflection patterns every time ("ReMOVE the magazine. RePLACE the magazine"). I can hear his voice in my head, as I type this. It's soothing to step through a routine with a very familiar soundtrack: my brain knows what's coming up, it has no reason to panic about what to do next, and my heartbeat slows down. One afternoon during high school, I had a bad break-up during lunch period and couldn't bear the thought of going to class. So, unable to face the world (or my stand partner) and feeling very sorry for myself, I skipped band. Terrified at the prospect of my school calling my parents to report an unexcused absence, I e-mailed my mom explaining the circumstances. The essence of her response was: it's fine, do what you need to do, but realize that you will probably feel better if you just go to class, even though that's the last thing you feel like doing. At MIT, there are inevitably periods when the semester gets out of control: the work pile overflows, I sleep through my alarm, I run out of cereal, etc. When all hell breaks loose, an alter-ego PANIC MODE version of my brain steps in. "Don't worry!" it says. "I'll save you! Stop going to class so that you can do more of your work; otherwise you won't get everything done! Sleep three hours later than usual, because sleeping is great!" PANIC MODE alter-ego brain is good at its job, which is to make emergency short-term decisions. Feeling exhausted? Sleep. Don't have enough free time to finish that pset today? Skip class to work on the pset instead. This is great on timescales of a single day or even a couple of days. But then the rough period passes (as rough periods inevitably do) and my usual brain takes over again and says HOW COULD YOU BE SO SHORT-SIGHTED?? LOOK WHAT YOU DID:  (image courtesy of xkcd) Don't listen to PANIC MODE brain. It doesn't make good long-term decisions. Resist dropping rank, resist dropping your usual routines with reckless abandon in a desperate attempt to hold too many things together.  2. Don't forget to bring your glasses My classmate forgot to bring her glasses for our end-of-semester shooting competition. She was pretty bummed out. Fortunately, my eyesight is so bad that it is physically impossible for me to travel more than a few feet without noticing that I've left my glasses somewhere. But really -- bring your glasses.  3. Don't be distracted by others' gunshots When you hear a gunshot, it's tempting to sneak a glance across the range and see how well your classmate is doing. The goal, of course, is to compare his or her performance to yours, because we're all obsessed with knowing in real-time how we measure up to others. This is a bad idea, regardless of what you see:1) If your classmate is doing better than you are, you might get nervous and anxious. Pressure mounts. Your pulse goes from a stroll to a speedwalk, or a jog, which is destructive to your steady shooting. PANIC MODE brain might step in to make some rash change-of-tactics decisions.2) If your classmate is doing worse than you are, you might get over-confident and lose your focus. Essentially, if you're looking at someone else's target, it means you're not focused on your own shooting. During a round, keep your eye on your own target. Fire each shot with as much focus as you can. After you're all done, look around if you really can't help yourself.   4. Every shot counts "I can't tell you," Mike told us, "how many times I've seen this happen." The goal is to fire six rounds. The competitor fires five perfect rounds, gets cocky, and the sixth goes totally haywire, ruining his score and essentially rendering all five previous successes meaningless. If things are going well, don't get complacent, because in the end the last shot is just as important as the first. Similarly, if your first shot is no good, don't give up and say "TO HELL WITH IT I DON'T CARE ABOUT THIS STUPID COMPETITION ANYWAY". Get over it, and shift your focus to making five perfect shots. For all you know, the person you're competing against might not have taken Mike Conti's pistol class: he might have watched you mess up, gotten complacent, lost focus, and misplaced his last shot.   But first I'm going to talk about the Toons. Some of you might recall that I'm in an a cappella group with a lot of really great people. Well, that a cappella group is having our last concert of the semester/calendar year at 8:00 in room 32-123 this Saturday, 12/7! We've been preparing like crazy to put together a kick-ass performance. There's a song by Vienna Teng with a glorious choral arrangement. There's dubstep piece with many wubs. There's a Red Hot Chili Peppers song with a guitar solo. In a cappella.  Of course, the concert's not limited to just singing, because who does a concert with just music? (Hint: it's not the Toons.) We've scrabbled together a series of skits in following with our concert theme, which is, for some reason, TOONS GO CAMPING.  (We also, by the way, have hilarious flyers.) It's been a little hectic preparing for this concert, between publicizing, preparing skits (we literally started learning them this Friday), and attempting to put together and remember choreography on top of memorizing all the music. Nevertheless--it should be a really good time and if you're anywhere vaguely in the vicinity of the Boston area you should come check it out. Details at our Facebook event here. Preparing for Toons, however, means that I'm feeling particularly musical these couple of days. Combine those with almost-the-end-of-the-semester feelings (last day of classes in next Wednesday, and finals week follows, then it's time for break!) and you get the Christmas playlist I decided to put together on Spotify. Here it is: I hope y'all enjoy the playlist. I'm also adding to it continuously, so I'd welcome any suggestions you have :) Happy Holidays, Allan see complete archives  I've ducked out of committee for a moment to let you know that, as the title says, we will be releasing Early Action decisions online next Saturday, 12/14, at 12:14 PM ET.

At 12:20pm, on December 4, 2013, Wednesday,  I had absolutely no idea where I was. A group of women trudged past me. I looked around wonderingly, walking past a Dunkin Donuts stand and a row of subway fare machines. I stared at signs reading Ashmont, Braintree, Red Line. Are they here? I wondered to myself. I dont know. Doesnt seem like it. Of course, I went against my instincts and proceeded toward the signs. I would later find out I had headed in the wrong direction. An hour later, I would be in prison.-- At 12:25pm, Madison 17 called me. Where are you? she asked. I mumbled something probably nonsensical about underground trains and missing signs. I was at the Alewife T-Station, which comprised a towering building, stacks of parking lots, and an extensive underground subway system, translating to a rife chance to get lost. And lost I was. It took a few extra minutes of talking to Madison on the phone, and backtracking out of the vicinity of the trains toward the parking lots, for salvation to arrive in form of Tally 17, who spotted me from two floors above and waved. I just saw Tally! I told Madison excitedly. Im saved. I ran up to Tally, and a short while later, I was standing by a timeworn car with my Ancient Greek Philosophy professor, Lee Perlman, and two of my classmates from concourse, Tally and Madison. Well, that was traumatizing, I said in relief. Just glad we found you, Lee replied as we all got into his car. He set his GPS for Framingham, MA, slightly over thirty minutes away from Alewife, and the little journey began. All four of us began talking, and as youd imagine with MIT students sitting alongside their professor, a good deal of the discussion revolved around things wed recently talked about in classDescartes ontological argument for the existence of God, the evolution of ideas as time bypassed the era of the Ancient Greeks and approached that of the Moderns. When we got to Framingham, we noticed a sign reading, Beaver Street. This is where MIT should have been! said Tally, amused. I agreed. A short while later, Lee parked his car in between two others. We all got out; the cold air lashed out, biting. We stared at barbed-wire fences and grim-looking towers. We headed towards the visitors entrance of the Massachusetts Correctional Institution (MCI) Framingham, an all-female prison.--One extensive security check later, Lee, Tally, Madison and I trailed after two women, past the first building wed entered, into a courtyard of sorts. More barbed-wire fences spread around grassy slopes and brick structures. One of the women pointed at different buildings, explaining what they were. We passed through one that had originally been a female reformatory in the 1800s, usually punishing minor offenses, ranging from husband disrespect to scandalous dressing. We walked past a room in which several large and incredibly beautiful American Flags were being sown by inmates. Finally, we ended up in a small classroom, a rectangle of tables and chairs framing an expansive space. One of the walls, deeply red, bore the letters: Boston University. Turns out BU funds an educational program at MCI in which inmates get to take classes and ultimately earn a Boston University Bachelor of Arts degree for free. However, the purpose of the visit today wasnt for a classalthough I ended up learning a lot, a valuable lot. It was for interaction, a chance for us to talk to some of the inmates, and for them to talk to us. We eventually got seated and about six inmates joined us. They were varied, in age, height, race and length of prison sentences. They were incredibly friendly. They were very willing to talk. Lee spoke for a little bit about the Greek Philosophy class, about tracing ideas through time, about how long hed been teaching it. He also shared some amazing details about his high-school days, which I wont mention for obvious reasons, except to say, MIT Professors absolutely rock! Then Tally, Madison and I also shared rather intimate details of our lives. By itself, that was a great bonding experience. Finally, we got the chance to hear the inmates speak. One of them spoke about how the BU program had helped her adapt to MCI. Paraphrasing her, I got in here and everything was focused on me. There was absolutely no privacy, and it was a shock, moving from having a relatively quiet life, where my business was my business, to MCI, where the scrutiny is intense, 24-7. I was glad at the opportunity to take classes. Id just pile on knowledge from the lectures; theyd keep me busy. Theyd let me focus on other things. Theyd help me move on. I completed the BU program two years ago, so I actually have a college degree. When I get out of here, I actually have a chance to restructure my life. Its something Im grateful for, something I try to pass on to the other inmates. I try to get them interested in the program. The others had similar stories. The BU program was optional, but the alternative was an endless stretch of months filled in with nothing but the assigned institutional jobs and some interaction with others. One of them spoke about a woman who had expected to be in MCI for life. Shed taken about four BU classes through the program, but had ultimately decided to stop. Suddenly, something in her case had changed, a successful appeal perhaps, a granted parole. Either way, she was free, but regretted having not seized the chance to have obtained the degree. It would have made a world of difference for her upon release if she had. The prospect of education filled them up; it was dignifying and personally rewarding. That chance also gave them a strength to go on every day. From one of them: I was a mess when I got here; I remember just bawling my eyes out during the trial. And then I got into this program and I felt more confident. Now, I just live in the moment. I dont try to count down on anything; I just push through every day, knowing that when the next day comes, Ill have the strength to do push through again. Some of them spoke more extensively about their lives prior to incarceration, painting a very strong picture of the chances one got in life. Dealt cards that were rotten. An ideal line of path that was suddenly upturned by a mistake. They had taken responsibility for their actions, but they hadnt let the fact that they were in a medium/maximum security facility bring them down. They had taken to learning, excitedly, progressively. They had taken to staying optimistic, thinking of the mistakes that had gotten them in, and of the ways they could make the best out of a difficult situation. You can either let this place break you, or you can make a good life out of it.--We left a few hours later, after getting the chance to see an extensive collection of paintings by one of the inmates. I remember staring at those pictures, the intense blends of varying colors, their shades and shadows forming potent images that remained etched in my mind. The artistic talent was amazing. It was just amazing. This is really powerful, said Madison. We all agreed. As we headed out, towards Lees car, we talked about what wed seen. Tally was struck by their positive will, their optimism. Despite everything, something keeps them going, she said. If there was ever any reflection of the adage that human spirits can stay strong in the face of darkness, that people can make personally uplifting opportunities out of absolutely anywhere and anything, it was reflected in those inspiring women. But one thing... Tally observed. According to the women, there are about twenty inmates in the BU program, but the prison has about six hundred and fifty inmates. Lee started his car. Yeah, we actually met the most strong-willed, most positive ones, he said. I wondered aloud what made the difference between them and the others. And of course, it was in the difference of the choices they had made. Choices. This was amazing, said Madison. I looked back at the buildings as we left, inspired. Wow, was all I could say. By the time I arrived at MIT, the sun had long set. I was still thinking of them. see complete archives   Today in Boston it was 41 degrees Fahrenheit and rainy. Random Hall had a massive potluck Thanksgiving dinner with our housemaster Nina and her family, and several smaller Thanksgivings branching off of it (because one wasnt enough). I wasnt there. I was sitting at a picnic table on the edge of a quiet, salty lake, watching my little brother feed geese and seagulls from the bank. I spent Thanksgiving in Myrtle Beach, northern South Carolina, sweater weather. Like geese, my family migrates when it gets cold every year, to Miami for New Years and a Green Christmas and to Myrtle Beach for Thanksgiving and Hanukkah. My parents drove down with my brother from Pennsylvania a week ago and I joined them on Thursday morning (Penn State gets a much longer Thanksgiving break than us). Thanksgiving for me is the beach, yoga classes twice a day, and almost absolutely no work, which is something I was bad at freshman and sophomore year but Ive gotten better. I think what we eat at Thanksgiving captures a wonderful picture of our cross-cultural family identity. Thanksgiving dinner this year was borscht with garlic and rye bread, turkey with homemade plum sauce, because Im allergic to cranberries, and farina cake after a walk on the beach and Catching Fire at the movie theater by the yoga studio. I miss this kind of food when Im away from my family. Over the past semester I asked my family to teach me how to cook the foods I love, and Ive been trying to make most of them during actual work weeks. I was surprised that they are almost all very easy to make, and that its possible to have a real dinner without taking real time away from studying. Four years ago when I was a senior in high school I tried to learn how to cook from a cookbook but I ended up mostly baking, and everything else was all very hard. Most of what I ate freshman year was cereal and skim milk. I didnt end up learning the more interesting fast dishes until now. In celebration of my new steps toward real adulthood, and in belated celebration of Thanksgiving, here are the 42 (plus or minus a few; I kind of cheated) recipes that encompass most of the foods I love. Some are from family, some are from family friends, and a few are from friends at MIT. This blog post is mostly for me but it is also for you, in case you live in a non-dining dorm or youre not on a meal plan and you want to learn some fast, diverse recipes to get you through the semester.  Starting with the basics: breakfast, lunch, and snacks on hell weeks.Effort: 1Ingredients: Steps: For when youre kind of hungry and its 4 am on Thursday (well, Friday, but you tell yourself its still Thursday) and your 5.111 p-set is due in seven hours.

Part 2 contains another 19 recipes, most of them a little more hardcore. There are also some places to buy food around MIT and some non-food things that are useful to have.  see complete archives  This is the more hardcore half or so of the 42 recipes. Most of these I dont get to make much during the semester, except on slow weeks or when I really, really dont feel like p-setting. At the end there are also places to buy food around MIT and some useful non-food things to have. If you havent, you should also read part 1.  Effort: 3Ingredients: Steps: Unfortunately I cant eat this anymore because I am allergic to most fruit. Hopefully well find an alternative. Here is the recipe I adapted it from.Effort: 3Ingredients: Steps: One wonderful thing about slow cookers is that meat winds up tender even if it was not high quality to begin with. Another is that there are zillions of crockpot meat and chicken recipes on the Internet for you to explore. My favorite source is A Year of Slow Cooking. A great recipe to start with is chicken with tomatoes. This recipe was invented by a close family friend, Ellen Tatcher. Her son and my brother are in the same after-school swim class. Sometimes when my mom doesnt have a timepoint to run catch they get to hang out, my mom gets to learn new recipes, and my dad, my brother, and I get to eat amazing new things. Spaghetti squash has become one of our favorite dinners.Effort: 3Ingredients: Steps: This is another recipe from Ellen. She did not invent this one but she did improve it.Effort: 3Ingredients: Steps: Buckwheat is a grain eaten a lot in Russia and a lot less in most other places. It does not take much effort to prepare and it can be eaten for pretty much any meal. This is my dads recipe. It can be extended to almost any other grain.Effort: 3Ingredients: Steps: Buckwheat goes well with meat and not as well with fish. A Russian friend of mine eats it with cheese melted on top. It is also very good if you heat it up in a bowl and add cold milk. My mom used to make me   when I got sick. Its really good but really hard to get right, which makes it extra special.Effort: 3Ingredients: Steps: This is from my grandmother on my dads side, and another wonderful food my mom makes for me when I get sick. Effort: 4Ingredients: Steps: My maternal grandmother taught me how to properly cook lentils when she came to visit me a few weeks ago. This might be the best way possible to eat lentils.Effort: 4Ingredients: Steps: Effort: 4Ingredients: Steps: This is yet another recipe from Ellen. Cory also makes something similar.Effort: 4Ingredients: Steps: One of my best friends Josh from seventh grade came to Boston a few days before finals last semester and taught me how to cook some things. Josh is majoring in computer science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. He is also an amazing (amazing) cook. He probably thinks its silly that I'm posting baked beets when he can cook so many other things, but I like beets.Effort: 4Ingredients: Steps: These go well with buckwheat or with mashed potatoes.Effort: 4Ingredients: Steps: Effort: 4Ingredients: Steps: The above is the traditional Russian recipe. Cory and I both think it is too sweet and too lemony. Since it was easy to get rid of by emailing the dorm I guess not everyone thinks thats a bad thing. If you do not like sweet things, cut the sugar and the lemon in half.  This is quite possibly the most delicious dessert in the history of desserts.Effort: 4Ingredients: Steps: This recipe is from my great-grandmother  (Zhenya, or Eugene), whom my grandmother on my dads side is named after. Apparently I spent a lot of time learning how to walk at her house, carrying a stuffed plushie monkey by the tail for what I apparently thought was stability.Effort: 5Ingredients: Steps: This is from Cory R. 14.

This is how recipes work in my family.Effort: 5Ingredients: Steps: This is a cross-national soup my mom makes alternately with .Effort: 5Ingredients: Steps: Effort: 0Ingredients: Steps: There is an unlimited supply of other foods you can try cooking that exist on the Internet. Again, I recommend searching for stir-fry and slow cooker recipes.  In addition, here is a list of kitchen items that I have found useful to have: If you live in a non-dining dorm almost all of these things will probably exist as community items in your kitchen. You should wait until you move in before you buy them. In retrospect, my floor had most things I needed and the only things I should have bought were: All of these things should be nice enough for you to enjoy but cheap enough for you not to miss too terribly when someone other than you inevitably gets them out of the dishwasher first and leaves them in the community drawers or the various dark corners of the dorm. They should also have sufficiently unique designs that you can track them down and reclaim them when they do eventually disappear.  And where to buy food? I get most of my food at Shaws (Star Market; B, below), because its a three-minute walk from Random Hall. Unfortunately Shaws does not have the best produce and can be needlessly expensive. When my grandmother came to visit me she found a farmers market in a parking lot near Central Square. (Isnt my grandmother amazing?) It appears every Monday from noon to 6 pm, at Bishop Allen Drive and Norforlk Street (C, below), unfortunately up to the Monday before Thanksgiving. You should check them out in the spring. You can get there by following the beautiful graffiti alleyway across from where Pearl Street dead-ends into Mass. Ave. View Larger Map  There is another farmers market in Kendall Square on Thursdays and a produce stand on Tuesdays in the Stata Center, both of which are closer for almost all of campus. I think the latter might even still be happening. If youre very adventurous you should also try some of the other options around MIT, organized into this convenient map by Mollie B. 06: View Boston-area stores in a larger map  My little brother Max made up a recipe for lemon iced tea that reportedly tastes just like Snapple. He is awesome and this is his recipe.Effort: 2Ingredients: Steps: Youre adorable, I said. No comment, he responded.  If you want more, here are other blogs posts about dining or recipes on the admissions blogs: (This is just what I found by Googling. If you find even more, post a link in the comments and I will add it here.) And that is all, for now. One turkey, seven yoga classes, and four and a half wonderful days with family later I am sitting on a warm windowsill, waiting for my late evening flight back to Boston, writing. And theyre already playing Christmas music. I hope you had a wonderful Thanksgiving, surrounded by people you love, and that there is wonderful food in your present and future. It was 2AM. After a heart-warming and tummy-filling Thanksgiving break with my parents and my favorite sister (shes kind of my only sister, but thats beside the point) I found myself sitting in front of my desk, the room empty, and my roommates still gone. The glare of my laptop screen illuminated three sheets of paper covered in a few inked drawings for my next blog post and I took a dainty sip from my aluminum water bottle. The water tasted strangely of swimming pool. Weird. All that was left was to make the sprint from Maseeh Hall to the Student Center to use the scanner in CopyTech and my belated post could finally be uploaded. I probably should have just waited until the next morning when normal people usually run errands. But sleep deprived brains convinced me otherwise. After putting on my jacket and pulling up my toasty sweatpants, I channeled my inner polar bear and barreled through the front door. The wind was predictably cold and the Student Center was empty except for a lady in a puffy jacket minding her own business. Anyway, I was in high spirits until a minute later when all my hopes and dreams were shattered. Everything is more dramatic at 2 in the morning. The scanner in CopyTech was broken and a blinking error message smiled up at me. No amount of random button pushing could get my pictures scanned and my goal of finally fulfilling my blog posting duties was momentarily derailed. And that, my friends, is why this post is sadly devoid of any visual aids. But never fear! Once the scanner gets fixed, another post shall materialize, filled to the brim with questionable artwork drawn by yours truly. This last week has been as close to a Hell Week as Ive ever been. You might be wondering, "what is a Hell Week anyway?" Excellent question. According to Urban Dictionary, Hell Week is a situation in which a person spends a long period of time forgoing sleep and sometimes other necessities to prepare for something. I highly recommend Urban Dictionary for all your slang needs, as long as your slang needs include reading exceedingly unreliable, crowd sourced definitions of colloquial terms. In this case, however, Urban Dictionary spit out a rather tame and accurate entry. While sleep was not entirely forgone and no meals were skipped (I fail to see how it is humanly possible to skip meals; I am hungry, hear me roar), I had a lot more work than usual. As a freshman, I dont think Im qualified to use that phrase to its fullest extent, especially considering how short the week was. Upperclassmen constantly regale me with harrowing tales of back to back exams or days filled with essays, psets, and lab work. They make no efforts to spare the gory details. In comparison, my week seems benign. But Im only a freshman, so Ill take my Hell Weeks in manageable increments, thank you very much. I had a 7.012 exam Monday night, a 8.01 exam Tuesday night, a 5.112 pset due Wednesday morning, and a 24.09 philosophy essay due Wednesday at 11:59pm. I really shouldnt be complaining though, because as soon as the barrage of work ended, Thanksgiving break descended upon the MIT masses and we were granted a four day reprieve. Hopefully as the semesters go by, Ill figure out how to manage my time better. Maybe next year, my sister wont have to sit on my bed twiddling her thumbs for an hour as I feverishly try to submit my philosophy essay before the deadline. For now, everything is great, and with only 20 more days until winter break, Im downright giddy. The only thing that stands between me and a plane back to California is a final essay and three final exams. I guess I better get studying. see complete archives  This summer I wrote a bloggerGuilt script to help me keep track of posting patterns on the blogs. But when I ran it earlier this morning, I realized that I was in the lower half of the distribution of blogs by various metrics, meaning I myself had been a bad blogger.  I'll spare you the various excuses and instead try to make it up to you. I'm sitting at home in New Hampshire on my couch in the sun, alternately working on neglected projects and napping while my mom watches old movies and unpacks Christmas decorations. Tomorrow I'm moving, and then we're starting to meet in Early Action committee, so I'll be reading applications instead of comments.  But for the next ~12 hours or so I will try to answer any question you ask below, about admissions or anything else really. You can also consider it an open thread to post interesting things you've recently learned, read, or watched. It's a holiday weekend, and I think most of our American readers will probably be lazing around digesting like me. So let's all hang out.    Currently listening to Currently with: Raymond, Lucy, and Shannia Currently drinking: Odwalla Superfood Currently feeling: warm and cozy in the Shire, floor 4West, Next House, Cambridge, MA. This weekend was, of course, Thanksgiving weekend. I have...a lot to be thankful for. Mom, if you're reading this--thank you for everything. I know I wouldn't be able to be here at MIT without you and all the lessons you've taught me growing up. I'm grateful every day for all the opportunities and experience I'm able to have because of you, as well as the future I have ahead of me. I'm sorry I didn't spend this Thanksgiving at home--I promise I'm thinking of you and the family. I'm thankful for all the new people I've met in the 3+ months I've been here. Being at MIT has really opened my eyes to so many new perspectives and ways of life that I just never even considered or thought to consider before. And being at MIT has also led me to find people like-minded to me, people with whom I share values or with whom I have common interests, people who I now can't imagine not knowing. "Kindred spirits," so to speak, as Anne of Green Gables might say--the best part of college may be kindred spirits. I'm also thankful for right here, right now. I'm catching up with old friends from high school (shout-out to our friends in Fremont!), who came to Boston to hang out over break. On Thanksgiving day, we went to Chinatown for Thanksgiving dinner and had a delicious Taiwanese-style meal with wontons and chow mein and scallion pancakes and sweet and sour pork...to be perfectly honest, Next House Dining is awesome but it doesn't match up to authentic Taiwanese cuisine. Chinatown also meant, of course, boba (aka bubble tea aka milk tea). Boba as an institution is a little hard to explain. I'll give you this instead. After stopping by a bakery to buy some roll cake (for breakfast the next day) and some egg tarts, we browsed Chinatown for a while before deciding to stop for more food--this time, pho (Vietnamese noodles). At the pho place we met up with some more friends from New York and then headed back to Next House. Here's what Next House looks like right now. It's below freezing, cold enough for there to be ice puddles in the streets (incidentally, the existence of ice puddles for some reason surprised me--it's just not something I considered would be a part of cold weather here. Everyone talks about snow and wind--no one mentions the ice puddles). There are two Christmas wreaths over our two front doors, and a big, shiny, warmly-lit Christmas tree in the Next House first-floor lounge by the mailboxes and the piano. There's a small square table with some couches. It's warm just by nature of being inside and cozy with candle-like lighting. Our friends from New York go to music school, so someone started playing the piano as someone else pulled out a mahjong set. Mahjong is kind of like Chinese poker--it's a four-player card game played with ceramic tiles and has, for a lot of us, associations with parties, holidays, good food, and friends. The next day, Black Friday, our main event was a night at the Boston Symphony Orchestra for opening night of the Handel and Haydn Society's annual production of Handel's Messiah, the oratorio from which the famous Hallelujah chorus originates. For our culture fix we got dressed up as nicely as we could while staying warm for the bus ride and walk across the river. Hearing the Messiah live really was something indescribable--all I can really say is that we went and it was amazing. For those of you in Boston, I highly recommend going. There's a student discount so tickets are only $25, and it really just is a breathtaking way to start the Advent season.  And that's just that, I suppose--between the temporary respite from schoolwork, the time with friends old and new, the good music and the frosty weather, it's starting to feel like Christmas. The city is lit up with ice and snowflake decorations and leafless trees draped with Christmas lights. Life is good.xoxoxo Allan You: Where are you from?Me: London.You: But you...you don't...you don't seem to have a British accent.Me: Correct. Let me explain!

Anna's personal Splash stats:573 High School students1 or 2 teachers (I co-taught two classes)5 classes, 8 sessions10 hours of classes Before I go on, I need to comment: this was the day of the Doctor Who 50th Anniversary Special release, and Splash was overrun by Doctor Who fans. I was wearing earrings that said "wibbly wobbly timey wimey" and my audiences were littered with sonic screwdrivers and Tardis t-shirts. I managed to slip in a reference during one of my classes, to thunderous applause.  - My first class was at 10am on Saturday. I showed up at 9:40 (we're supposed to arrive half an hour before our first class - sorry, ESP admins) and received a hard copy of my schedule for the day.  Here is a Google calendar representation.  Note that I had a biology exam Monday night. Good life choices, Anna! As you can see from the schedule, I taught most of my classes in 26-100, which is MIT's biggest lecture hall. Movies are shown in there. The 2013 Ig Nobel Prize lectures were held in there.  It was totally surreal to lecture where Eric Lander lectures. It was also totally surreal to try and 1) turn on the lights and 2) make the projector system work, because despite 26-100 being a gigantic lecture hall, nobody thought to make these systems usable by the average human. I spent about ten minutes running around looking for the light switch, then ten minutes running around looking for the right plug (THERE ARE SO MANY PLUGS AND CORDS IN THAT ROOM) and then it was already five minutes into my class so I had to give up. I called ESP security (the team of MIT student volunteers who really make Splash go) and they sent help while I improvised a non-Powerpoint version of the beginning of my class. (Those 5-min improv classes came in handy!) Emily T. '15 came in and magically found the light switch, and Ian M. '14 magically made the projector work.  ESP SECURITY: I LOVE YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU.  Class summaries: Geocentrism to Exoplanets was about the progression of humanity's understanding of our place in the grand scheme of things. We started in the modern era of astronomy, and I presented some of the most recent highlights of exoplanet science. We then took a big step back to 1923 (when Hubble discovered that there are in fact other galaxies) then another big step back to the discovery that the sun is just another star, then even further back to 16th century Poland, where Copernicus was writing to suggest that the Sun and not Earth is at the center of the universe. With that context under our belts, we returned to exoplanet science. I talked about the first discovery of exoplanets (which entails talking about pulsars, which I'm always very happy to do) then showed examples of exotic planetary systems that have been discovered: the Tatooine-esque binary star system, for example, and the planets that share an orbit. Spontaneous 5-Minute Classes on Whatever You Want was exactly what it sounds like. I wrote about it here. As expected, there was a good twenty-minute period before class started when I had an existential WHY DID I SIGN UP FOR THIS? crisis, but the class itself was a resounding success and everyone had a blast. Davie '12 and I managed to procure a bunch of miscellaneous props (a foam sword, a beet, and a sheepskin, among other things) and the kids were all too eager to suggest ways for us to publicly humiliate ourselves.  Here were some of their submissions: Yes, "how to pick up chicks" was submitted several times. Ah, High School. Davie got "Elephants," "Colors - How do they work? (why do they exist?)" and "How to be a sloth." He also combined "The Architectural styling of I. M. Pei," with "Murder (any insight on topic)" to deliver a fantastic 5-minute class about how I. M. Pei's buildings could kill you.  I got "The banana and how it changed history," "How to swordfight," and "How to pick up chicks." I pulled out the random foam sword that we had lying around, got a volunteer from the audience (he happened to be a fencer) and taught them all how to fence foil and sabre (Thank you, MIT PE!) For "how to pick up chicks," I did some quick thinking then said: "So, I actually have a lot of personal experience picking up chicks." Cue gaping. I noticed that one girl had her iPhone out, and was filming me. Great. "In fact, I picked up a lot of chicks while I was in elementary school in Singapore." More gaping. "I did it in the local science museum." I really enjoyed drawing out the silence between my sentences.  "There was an exhibit - an incubator, and in the incubator there were chicken eggs waiting to hatch. When the chicks hatched, the museum attendants let you pick them up." Laughter. One kid yelled, "I SEE WHAT YOU DID THERE!" and I got a round of applause. I continued with my cop-out, explaining the delicate art of how to pick up a chick without strangling it.  During our second class session, we had about three times the number of kids (from ~40 to ~120) so I'm not going to write up all of their submissions. I received something like "Tell us all about the trombone" - I played the trumpet for eight years and had plenty to say about brass instruments. I also received "Black Holes," which was totally cheating since I'm an astrophysicist. I guess the universe thought I had it too easy, because I then got "How to draw the Mona Lisa blindfolded," which of course had to involve drawing the Mona Lisa on the chalkboard while blindfolded. Here is the real Da Vinci painting:  Here is my blindfolded chalk drawing:  For clarity:  I'd say I got it pretty close. Dramatic Reading: Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead was also exactly what it sounds like. Eight high schoolers, Davie '12 and I did a full reading of Tom Stoppard's play. We modeled it after MIT's literature department's annual marathon, which brings together a group of students and professors to read a play in its entirety. At natural breaks, we switched up roles, so that everyone got to read about an equal amount. This drew a very different crowd from my astronomy classes. The Multicolor Universe was a class that I've been wanting to design for a long time. Essentially, one can do astronomy at every wavelength of the electromagnetic spectrum: x-ray astronomy, infrared astronomy, ultraviolet astronomy, etc. I happen to do radio astronomy, but am hoping to broaden out in graduate school. Here's the first slide of my class:  And the second slide:  We talked about the different kinds of objects and phenomena represented by different parts of the spectrum (ex. warm gas and dust in the infrared, gamma ray bursts in the gamma ray, black holes in the x-ray) as well as the different instruments and telescopes used to collect that data. Some are ground-based, because some parts of the spectrum make it down to Earth's surface, but others must be space-based, because the atmosphere blocks dangerous wavelengths like gamma rays from frying us.  In between classes, I hid in the library and frantically taught myself about lymphocytes, antibodies, the cellular and humoral immune responses, familial hypercholesterolemia, mouse chimera, oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, viruses, why vaccines work (memory cells!!!), and single-nucleotide polymorphisms. I had my biology test last night, and I think it went fine, despite the weekend's chaos. I'll finish with some special moments. This was a very special weekend.  Im in my room, clacking away on my laptop, my fingers slowly defrosting, bits of ice forced into my intestines (by Cambridges spooky weather) slowly melting, and I feel pretty good. Its been a while I typed up something that wasnt a p-set or a study paper, a consequence of the past three weeks sapping so much time. The barrage of classes, problem-sets and exams all culminated in two midterms this past Monday, alongside a p-set I turned in one Ed Sheeran song before the deadline. Needless to say, I spent a large amount of time yesterday going through way too many equations, free-body diagrams and cancer-modeling pictures, splayed in different positions. Sometimes, I work sprawled on my bed, usually when Im reading. Mostly, I hunch over a makeshift tablewhat kind of makeshift, you definitely dont want to know. A few times, I sit on the floor and try to think things through. For rather difficult problems, sitting seems kind of hard to do while thinking of solutions, so I like to walk around in small circles, muttering to myself, twirling my fingers in the air, undoubtedly looking insane to any invisible observers. There are these spurts of time that feel like a great, cool intake of air after youve held your breath for way too long, spurts that come typically after curling the final integral sign onto the last problem of a p-set or after drawing a sad smiley on the final page of a difficult midterm and hoping you get credit for the dimples. And suddenly, youre kind of...free? Only for a while, but yes, it feels like temporary freedom, to just take a breath and relax without feeling too guilty. This is quite the rant, and I guess its one born of euphoria. Im done with midterms for the semester. No more exams until the Finals roll around in the middle of next month. There are still p-sets though, but we can forget about those for now. For now, I feel good.--I also felt good last Friday. I had just finished a calculus midterm exam...and it felt odd because that was the first time in MIT I had completed an exam with several minutes to spare. This wasnt why I felt good though. I turned in my exam paper and headed to my dorm. On arrival, I saw my name on the big screen in the Foo Lounge of Random Hall, the screen that indicates the presence of mail. I wasnt expecting a package, so I was curious. My first thought had been something along the lines that my international secret government spy cover had been blown, and ninjas had left some device of doom that...oh, oh, its just a basket. But when I took the small wrapped basket from the friendly front desk person, I realized it wasnt just a basket.  It was full of candy, chocolate-covered pretzel sticks, gummy bears, crackers, and a note from my roommate, saying in the last few lines: thanks for being an awesome roommate; I would probably be crying in a hole right now if you werent here. Me? Awesome? Clumsy, sure, but awesome? Needless to say, I stood there, smiling as widely as any person could, the ends of my mouth probably whipping past my ears in a curl. It was both unexpected and delightful, and I was grateful for it. The Cambridge Weather, to which we shall now address as Evil, saw to it that my happiness was as short-lived as possible, bringing howling winds and a spirit-drenching cold that night and the following day. The only upside to that was being able to breathe out and see white puffs of air float out like ghosts, while wondering if that was movie-esque (yes, that word is made up). However, even with multiple layers of clothingsometimes in questionable combinations of jackets, sweaters and hoodiesI still felt like I was navigating the deepest parts of a gigantic refrigerator. --Over the rest of the weekend, I watched the MIT Chorallaries astound a large crowd with incredible singing, explored a bit of Cambridge, felt my dorm literally shake (construction nearby, old building, long story), spammed a mailing list with nothing but eom, ran around a maze of students that had brought energy, enthusiasm and cameras for the Splash weekend, and eventually got around to studying for my two midterms. Physics went fine; Biology went a whole lot better than the last time, although one of the questions about single nucleotide polymorphism chips, vaguely resembling a computer-science/advanced-combinatorics hybrid had me stumped. I have since thenby which I mean, a few seconds agofound out the answers, and have a good mind to kick myself in the head. 7.012Intro Biois definitely a very challenging intro GIR; it also has its moments. Recently, a lot of it. Beyond learning about the cold, hard facts of vesicular microsomes and transcription factors, we sometimes delve into the human workings behind those facts, the little strokes of luck that brought about certain major discoveries, the simple experiments that paved way for larger, more complex ones...and I recently got a sense of something, from one of the classes in which Eric Lander tied in everything we had learned thus far to developing drugs for a certain heart disease. I got the sense of how beyond the 1400 pages of our textbook and the words uttered in class, beyond the teeth-kicking problem sets, everything we had learned in 7.012 this semester connected like meshing gears to hold up the fabric of the world. It felt like if I really thought about these things, genomic variation, nucleotide mutations, the workings of immunology, I could see them taking on bigger forms, yielding impacts. Im in my first semester at MIT, and Ive struggled a lot with Biology, but Ive also been amazed by it, and understand that over the course of the upcoming semesters, MIT is going to split my mind open. My vague appreciation of how the things we learn in class can actually translate into changing the world in some not-at-all-over-idealized way is probably going to bloom. And it feels like...it just feels like MIT is preparing us to go out there and make those impacts. Ive never really sat down and thought to myself, I can make a huge difference... because on the surface, that might sound silly and nothing more than proverbial, but in 7.012, I realize it isnt. Serendipity would play a role somewhere; a lot of it would have to come from a great amount of hard work, but MIT saw something in me, and in everyone else that calls the Institute home, and MIT said, You can do it. However, MIT also likely sees it in people that may never call the Institute home. The first round of admissions decisions will be out soon, and the committee is going carefully through thousands of applications, digging themselves into your lives. Hopefully, theyll come to understand the things that get you excited, the little segments of your lives that blend like jigsaw puzzles to define you. Theyll have to make extremely tough decisions, but regardless of the outcome, theres a hope and energy that echoed in the pagesor pdf filesof your applications, one that shouldnt ultimately hinge on a letter of acceptance or rejection. Very soon, in a blog post or two, Im going to talk about the journey that led me to MIT, about the events that took place during the gap year that could easily have had me elsewhere. And I think the one thing I understood from reflecting on that now is thisI had things I had woven myself so deeply around that they were a part of me, ideas or activities that got me bristling, bubbling, overwhelmed. Those things were a big part of me when I sent in my application, and the outcome of the admissions committees decision existed totally independent of how strongly I felt and still feel about them. MIT is preparing everyone here to make a palpable difference in the world, but what exactly does this mean? The most important tools we have are our zeals, our enthusiasms, our brimming ideas, clashing, mingling, as the resources are set forth before us, but ultimately, anything we do hinges far more on who we arebefore we applied here, after we got our letters of acceptance and rejection from wherever we appliedand on having the sense that, because well still love science experiments, or art, or the bliss of music, or Ultimate Frisbee regardless of anything, well be able to use them as a platform for development wherever we are. The stories I learn about in 7.012, of Mendels experiment with the peas, of the sleepless night leading to Sturtevants conception of a genetic map, of the great role luck played in James Gusellas polymorphism idea, were ultimately more of tales of inquiry and perseverance paying off than of location. Its important to never lose track of the things that make you happy, and of the mindset that you have the potential to forge great things out of them.--Well, Im hungry right now, so Ill probably go scavenge the kitchen or hope for a free-food e-mail to land in my inbox. I get quite a number of free-food e-mails on an almost daily basis, and in fact, I think Ill do an e-mail search right now.  You see how there were four free-food e-mails this past Sunday? And one on Saturday and three on Thursday? Hopefully, therell be one more tonight. My senses are attuned to these kinds of e-mails like a ravenously roving satellite dish.--Well, its been a pretty good day (he says for the millionth time). I had to stay up really late studying and didnt get much sleep, but I took a brief power nap a few hours ago, and since then, Ive felt great. Its weird. I have no more work due this week. Theres a calculus problem-set for next week and a brief reading for my philosophy class, but thats relatively light, and it feels kind of weird, kind of amazing. Its also Thanksgiving this Thursday, but I have very little to say about that, since Im an international student, and its not really a thing in Nigeria. Regardless, I definitely have a lot to be thankful formy roommate, my friends, my family, my Alpha Delta Phi brothers, the people close to me, my sense of happiness right now, the eighty-five or so Taylor Swift songs on my phone, the idea that I can always whip out words to construct my thoughts and emotions and feel good doing that. And of course, the fact that MIT is giving us two days off classes. Ill probably spend a good portion of this week writing stories. You can read a short one I wrote a few weeks ago here, although it's fairly gory. I hope you guys have an amazing Thanksgiving this week, and have the chance to reflect on the things that make you bloom, the people that make you happy, the life you get to live now, and be thankful for them. For everything. Time does tick after all. Organic Chemistry is notoriously hard. But what isn't hard is having dinner with your organic chemistry professor-- which can be sponsored by MIT's Undergraduate Association! "WAIT FREE FOOD?" That's right. You and 2-5 friends can ask any of your professors out for a feast, to any restaurant. It'll definitely be better than dining hall food. Which actually isn't that bad. So therefore your outing will be inherently great. "HOW??" "BUT I'M NERVOUS..." Get yourself together. Sure your organic chemistry professor has almost 300 publications and 39 patents, but don't let that intimidate you. This is an incredible opportunity to develop a closer bond to some of the world's best faculty. They may be unbelievably accomplished, but they're also unbelievably human. We can learn much more than subject material through simple conversation. :) "OKAY. I'M READY!" Excellent! To make it into this semester you only have a few more weeks left. Here's the link to the official Student-Faculty Dinner Instructions and Registration page.    June P., Jonathan Z., Barbara L., and I all had an amazing time with Professor Swager (5.12) last week. If anyone reading this has attended a student-faculty dinner, UA sponsored or not, feel free to share below! This weekend marks the notable milestone where, for the first time in my life, I get to actually do cool engineering-y things with my actual hands for a research job. I have a UROP (Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program), which means I get to have an on-campus job doing cool sciencey things and learning cooler sciencey things and getting paid for it. I'm currently working in the Space Systems Laboratory helping to develop a docking port for little satellites on the International Space Station for testing autonomous docking algorithms. The idea is that you want to develop and test these sorts of things in an environment where if your algorithm doesn't work, an astronaut nearby can just pick it up and fix it (whereas if you were testing in Real Space, you would lose your tens of thousands of dollars of payload into the emptiness of space just because some idiot forgot a semicolon). Anyways. I spent the last month learning how to read circuit board schematics and getting firehosed about circuit theory and printed circuit boards in general. I've discovered that circuit boards are really cool and I'm learning tons about them from my UROP work. I applied to this UROP because I wanted to work in a Real Science Laboratory and do Real Science with my Real Hands, and that's actually exactly what I'm getting with all the circuit boards I'm swimming in these days. You see, one of the things I want most to get out of freshman year is to develop hands-on experience. For some reason I never got into building things (like FIRST robotics or that sort of thing) in high school, which means that even though I really love working with my hands, my actual building experience is somewhere between "I can follow the IKEA instructions" and "let's make a mousetrap car with cardboard and duct tape." Still, my mom always told me I had clever fingers. She also told me I should become a surgeon. She stopped after I said I wanted to cut up rockets instead of people. In any case, pursuing hands-on experiences in college led me to two extracurriculars: my UROP, which we've discussed, and the MIT Design/Build/Fly Team, which designs, builds, and flies remote control airplanes to fulfill missions for a national competition. Design/Build/Fly has been great--we've just finished test-flying two half-scale airplane designs and begun development of our final design. I can't say much more than that just because it's a competition and therefore kind of competitive, so the executive people are keeping things very hush-hush. Shhh. But one of the things I learned to do in Design/Build/Fly was soldering. Soldering strikes me as kind of an insane thing to do. It's like somebody said "we need a way to connect pieces of metal" and the solution they came up with was "let's take a hot metal stick and melt a third piece of metal and glob that third piece of metal onto the first two pieces." In any case, it's kind of delicate and at the same time kind of badass, becase it means working with hot things and metal (which is a big improvement from working with duct tape and cardboard). So when today my UROP graduate student mentor asked me to replace a motor in one of our prototypes and directed me towards the electronics room, it was with great satisfaction and ego that I sat down at a soldering station and started stripping wires to solder to the motor. Let's just say this--soldering is hard. De-soldering, the art of removing pieces of metal that have already been melted together, is even harder, because usually it's impossible to get all of it out the tiny little holes that you need to put new wires through. That's the story of how I learned to use a solder wick, which is a magical sort of solder-sponge that magically absorbs melted solder. Nevertheless, there was a lot of melted plastic on my motor by the time I'd finished soldering wires to it. When I emerged with my soldered blob of a motor and started installing it in the prototype, I was excited--no, expecting--to see it work and go home and call it a successful soldering day. It didn't work. I was very sad. I spent another fifteen minutes soldering wires to a new motor, because that old motor has seen too many things and has now been put in a retirement home where it can consult a therapist twice a week.  Fortunately with hands-on skills it really is a matter of practice makes perfect. That's why it only took me fifteen minutes for the second motor (which, thank God, worked beautifully). And that's why I'm doing this UROP, because I think it was the first time I was totally absorbed and focused and content with doing the work that I was doing. It's hard to get that feeling (for me, at least) when I'm sitting behind a computer screen on a desk clicking buttons to do things. It's things like soldering that make me realize why I'm pursuing an education here. Wheeeee. ~Allan In a nutshell or two: I'm a budding MechE, love building things, and like to pretend I can do a British accent.

It's one phrase - "a cappella", Italian for "in the manner of the church" (thanks, Wikipedia) - but it's two words.  Which means that you get weird phrases like "an a cappella group."  Or "many a cappella groups."   (if you're not familiar with a cappella, it's basically singing without instrumental backups.  like in Pitch Perfect!) Anyways, as you may know, a cappella is big at MIT - we've got the Logarhythms, Chorallaries, Toons, Cross Products, Resonance, Ohms, and probably some other groups that I've missed (please direct all complaints to Chris Peterson.  thanks) And what better way to relax after a long week than a free a cappella concert by the always impeccably-dressed Chorallaries?   There was a visiting a cappella group too - SQ, from Tufts!  They did a great cover of Macklemore - who, if you recall, I'm a big fan of.   ...and there was dancing...  ...and group hugs...  ...and much applause.  Have a great weekend! You: Where are you from?Me: London.You: But you...you don't...you don't seem to have a British accent.Me: Correct. Let me explain!

Concert #1: Verdi's Stabat Mater and Te Deum, performed by the MIT Symphony Orchestra (MITSO) and the MIT Concert Choir Thursday night, I destroyed both of my knees running three miles on a very inclined treadmill. I paid for my improper shoes / insufficient stretching by spending most of Friday with my legs propped up on a giant stuffed (toy) bear, balancing an ice pack and wincing. But I sucked it up and journeyed down the five flights of New House stairs because MITSO and Concert Choir were performing, and Whenever I watch MIT students perform, I get very emotional (or maybe it was the knee pain). I think about how everyone on the stage is an extremely hardworking MIT college student, I look at a violinist and wonder if he or she is a biological engineer or a chemist or a physicist, I think about how all of these people are sitting together and making beautiful music, and I cry. When my kids perform in the 2030s/40s they're going to hear sobbing from the audience and think "oh, COME ON, Mom! Get it together!" PS: MITSO and Concert Choir concerts are free for "members of the MIT community" (I guess: students, faculty, staff? alums?) who purchase their tickets in advance. And in case you're curious about upcoming concerts, here's the MITSO schedule and here's the Concert Choir schedule. Even if you know nobody in either ensemble, you should come. PPS: There is one French House resident in MITSO: Jacob '17 plays the bass. There are two French House residents in Concert Choir: Caitlin '15 and Lisa '17 are both altos.  Concert #2: Purcell's Dido and Aeneas, performed by the MIT Chamber Chorus Saturday afternoon (the afternoon after the MITSO concert) I walked to Killian Hall and was totally astonished when the ticket collector at the door whipped out an iPhone and let me through even though I had forgotten to print out my hard copy ticket. Wow. TECHNOLOGY! MIT's Chamber Chorus performed a fully-staged production of Purcell's opera, Dido and Aeneas. We studied this opera in my music class, and I was excited to hear familiar pieces being sung by my friends: Davie '12 was Aeneas (I used to be Davie's neighbor; my room used to vibrate with his humming), Caitlin '15, Elizabeth '14, and Troy '15 were in the chorus, Ben '14 was an excellent drunken sailor, and Lizi '12 was a heartless Spirit.  An interlude about the opera, for those of you who care: <interlude> Opera was not a Big Thing in 17th century England - certainly not in the way that it was a Big Thing in 17th century Italy and France. English "opera" consisted of short one-act plays that had musical scores and perhaps some song-and-dance interludes. There was a whole English "semi-opera" genre, with the now-counterintuitive feature that main characters did not sing because sung words are hard to understand. Musical entertainment and singing were left to the minor characters: they were an accessory, not the focus of the play. Henry Purcell was an organist at Westminster Abbey, which is very strange to think about. As a little kid, I cried and insisted on leaving Westminster Abbey, because the tombs and dead people and grey stone blocks freaked me out. About a decade later, I graduated in a building right across the street from Westminster Abbey. So, that building and I have history, and it's weird to think that Henry Purcell and I have stood on the same grey stone blocks. My feelings on Westminster Abbey aside, Purcell was a musical genius. Period. That said, I admit that his "brash and pungent style" (a perfect phrase from my textbook by Richard Taruskin) has been an acquired taste for me. In my music class, we listened to his Overture in D Minor and Sonata No. 3 in D Minor, which I could get along with -- but his Fantazia 7 in C Minor (which to my ear has no direction whatsoever) is a bit much. I do love his opera music, though. He was a superstar composer for the London stage, and his career highlights include The Fairy Queen and Dido and Aeneas.  When most people think of opera, they think: red plushy seats and people singing unintelligibly in a foreign language for FOUR HOURS. Or maybe that's just what I used to think of, before I saw Carmen and The Magic Flute (admittedly, these are two of the most accessible operas out there). Dido and Aeneas is only about an hour long, and is one of the only 17th century English operas that was meant to be sung through from beginning to end. The English language is particularly difficult to set to music, in part because long syllables are not necessarily the stressed syllables. It's cool to look at the opera score, and see the short-long (sixteenth note - dotted eighth note) rhythms that reflect typical English short-long word couplings (ex. "in peace," "so much"). And it is very weird to listen to an opera, think that it must be in a foreign language, and realize in a rare burst of intelligibility that it's in English. Anyway, Dido and Aeneas is a beautiful beautiful opera, and you should find a recording to listen to. Don't be scared; it's short! </interlude>.  MIT's production was staged by Lynn Torgove, who was adamant that it be characteristic to MIT. All the actors (aside from the one or two main characters in the scene) wore matching T-shirts and sneakers, and I noticed that Aeneas was wearing a brass rat. The performance was advertised as "dna@mit": Dido aNd Aeneas. Har Har. But for me, it would have been characteristically MIT even with fancy period costumes and a Royal Opera House setting, because of all the familiar faces in the cast. Flipping through the program bios, you see things like "Aeneas is a first-year Ph.D. student in Applied Math," "Dido is a sophomore...majoring in Computer Science," and "First Lady is a senior linguistics major." Actually, let me just list all of these, because they really give you a sense for why these productions are so special: Isn't that cool? I think it's cool. Where else are you going to see a Dido and Aeneas production starring a bunch of computer scientists / mathematicians / electrical engineers / aerospace engineers / chemists? PS: Lizi, Davie, Elizabeth, and Caitlin are all French House alums or residents. This means that a little over 20% of the cast is from French House. Considering that there are about 25-30 French House residents at any one time, and 4000 undergrads, that is statistically significant.  Concert #3: Lots Of Pieces, performed mind-bogglingly well by Joshua Bell at Boston's Symphony Hall It's kind of hard to know what to say about this. I'll start by telling you how I got a free ticket.  Done. Ah, the joys of being an Arts Scholar at MIT. I'm going to miss college. We all showed up ready to have our minds blown by Joshua Bell's virtuosity. The program read:  So, there was an element of mystery to the performance. Also, I want to mention that Joshua Bell plays a 1713 Stradivarius, which he bought for $4 million. The violin has a very dramatic history, and I'm glad that it gets played regularly instead of stuffed in a museum box for people to gawk at. After the Stravinsky piece, Joshua Bell took the microphone and with a mild "what? me? I'm good at the violin?" tone, said "we'd like to play a couple more pieces...an encore, whether you like it or not." Everyone applauded enthusiastically to indicate that yes, they would like it very much. He and his piano accompanist played Tchaikovsky's Melody, to more shrieks and applause. Finally, J. Bell took up the mic again and said "before I break the last hair on my bow, we'd like to play one more piece for you," and everyone applauded until their hands went numb. I didn't recognize and don't remember the name of the composer.  My most undignified moment during the performance was when I wrote a note to Davie asking if Joshua Bell does any composing -- then changed "composing" to "composting" and made myself giggle. During the walk back to MIT campus, Davie and I imagined what it would be like to be Joshua Bell's hairdresser, and wondered aloud whether the superstar violinist has donkey ears that only his hairdresser knows about.  Concert #4: Haydn's Opus 20 No. 2 in C Major, played by the Rowe's Lane Quartet Our 21M.235 professor brought in a professional Baroque period quartet to play Haydn's Opus 20 No. 2 in C Major (which we had been discussing in class) for us and answer any questions we had. This is the article that inspired the group to form (see the comments section) and here's a little advertisement from the Handel & Haydn Society.  As usual, I had infinite questions, most of them personal; I like to know how people got where they are. The first violinist started playing the violin in 4th grade, "like any other kid," and always had an interest in playing period instruments. Her violin was made by William Forster II in 1817 (father and son are described here) and doesn't have a chin rest because those were invented in 1820. The second violinist plays an instrument made in 2000 (lame!) but which is very exact replica of an instrument from the late 1600s. The cellist was by far the most talkative one of the four (I wonder if there are personality types associated with the different parts of a quartet...) and told us that: The viola player (viola-ist?) started by saying: "I'm Jenny, and my instrument was made by a nuclear physicists working for the British government." That got our attention. She went on to say that she originally came to the US and worked for a Japanese chef, because she didn't want to pursue a career in music. She ended up going back to a conservatory though, and only when she started teaching did she "really understand how to play the instrument."  I also asked what kinds of annotations they make in their scores. "We all have things that challenge us," Jenny said. "That informs the annotation." They also annotate what each other are doing, because they don't use full scores.  I asked if they have a favorite composer, and apparently that's like asking a mother who her favorite child is. The viola player (I think it was her?) said that she particularly likes Bach, because "you can play Bach on any instrument."  While the four women played, I thought about how different this performance was from Joshua Bell's. Joshua Bell stood on stage while I sat at the back of Symphony Hall. These four played two feet away from me, in an MIT classroom. I will probably never get anywhere close to Joshua Bell's fancy shmancy Stradivarius, while these four let us touch and even play their instruments. I swooned more during the former, but learned more during the latter.  This isnt goodbye, this is see you later! I told my family as they left that Monday, August 26 from Parents Orientation. It was true. Family Weekend was only at the end of October, a mere 59 days, 4 hours, 32 minutes, and 53 seconds away. But whos counting? In the mean time we stayed in minimal contact as I slowly matured into autonomous, independent adult. Just kidding! I still called my mom whenever I was sick. I still talked to my family every few days. But this isnt a story about me finally being able to do laundry by myself or to know which medicine I should take for what symptoms. This is a story about how I survived Family Weekend.   It was Friday, October 25th. My family was coming at 10am. I knew I had to wake up early enough to clean and prepare for their arrival, so I set my alarm for 8am. I woke up at 11. After throwing everything underneath my bed or in the closet, I put on my best MIT gear and made the ten-minute trek to campus. I met up with them at the Student Center - my mom, my dad, and my three younger brothers. They had even brought my grandparents and my uncle from Costa Rica. I couldnt wait to show them all around. During CPW, I was just as lost on the MIT campus as they were. But this time, I had already been here for two months. I knew how to navigate the academic buildings and where the different labs are. I had to find something that I could show them. Something thats a perfect representation of MIT culture. So I showed them a 400lb grand piano plummeting seven stories to its death onto an equally bulky 400lb grand piano waiting on the grass.    The massive crowd that gathered to watch the piano drop.  Turns out the piano was filled with candy.  They called it a "pianata".  People scurried to the crashed piano for the candy. My parents and I alongside one of my friends and his parents.   Watching 800lbs of wood shatter, metal bend, and candy splatter sure builds up an appetite. Where should we have dinner? Some nice restaurant in Boston? Cambridge? Nah, my parents wanted Maseeh Dining. I didnt blame them. When I first got here, I loved Maseeh Dining. I came from a high school that consisted of pizza, cold turkey sandwiches, and milk served in a tiny carton for lunch. Eating at Maseeh was like eating at a four star buffet on a broke college students budget. You walk in to chandeliers on the ceiling (or maybe Im just imagining the chandeliers because of the regality of the place). I had told my parents again and again about Maseeh and how great it was, so that was naturally their choice of dinner. I used nearly all of my guest passes, but we managed to get all nine of us in there. I felt so bad for the chefs! We enjoyed ourselves to the plethora of lasagna, fries, burgers, salads, fruits, hot dogs, bread, cookies, orange juice, milk, and ice cream. Because of my meal plan, I had Maseeh nearly every day and it had become commonplace. However, my family still saw it as an amazingly wide selection of foods. Interestingly, that made me begin enjoying it again, even though Ive had it nearly every day. After dinner, my family went off to attend one of MITs concerts and I went off to a meeting.   On Saturday, I got up earlier. MUCH earlier. 8am early. They wanted to see my frat house. And I wanted to make sure it was clean. Our frat has the reputation of being one of the cleanest houses at MIT, and all of the brothers and pledges make sure it stays that way. We clean the house weekly, taking care of it and making sure everything is in order. Our frat was holding a small barbecue for Family Weekend. When my family arrived, they were greeted by some of the brothers and met several others while inside. I told my family about all the exciting things we did during Rush and during my first two months as a pledge. They also chatted it up with the parents of other Hispanic pledges in the frat. Speaking of Hispanic, it was time for Cena a las Seis (Dinner at Six for those without Google Translate), an annual Family Weekend event held by the Latino Cultural Center. It was semi-formal, and we enjoyed a traditional Latino dinner with student performances and presentations, along with talks by representatives from the various different Hispanic student groups. It was a lot of fun, and I even got a great picture.    After Cena a las Seis, my family couldve chosen just to go their hotel and call it a night, but, of course, I couldnt let them leave without them seeing one of the most important parts of MIT Culture - a cappella. So I took them to the Greater Boston Invitational Songest, an a cappella concert held in Kresge Auditorium. We were amused by the Muses, entertained by the Toons, and surprised by the Asymptones. They sang an a cappella version of "The Fox" by Ylvis. My personal favorite was the crossover between "Badtameez Dil" and Shakiras "Whenever, Wherever" performed by the Ohms (Seriously, if any of you Ohms ever read this, that was amazing!).   Afterwards, we went back to my family's hotel room and watched Man of Steel. I had some nice talks with my parents and some bonding time with my brothers by playing the games we always used to play. We spent the next morning exploring Boston. Then we visited Harvard and walked around wearing our MIT gear. Family Weekend was coming to an end. When it finally came time for goodbyes, none of use felt too sad. Why? Because we knew that it wasn't "goodbye". It was only "see you later". Now there's only 9 days, 21 hours, 8 minutes, and 32 seconds until Thanksgiving. Although this blog probably would've been more appropriately posted at the beginning of the year, I think the photographs that our freshmen took deserve to be shared with the blogosphere!  Discover Product Design is a freshman preorientation program (FPOP) at MIT, which I participated in as a freshman...  and now help coordinate! During the short five day program, we introduce the freshman to the world of product design through a variety of interactive lectures, awesome design projects, and some visits to firms like Eleven, THE MEME, and even a hardware accelerator called Bolt. They also get a chance to explore the city of Boston and learn about resources on campus where they can build things themselves! I'd definitely share more details about the program on the blog, but I don't want to ruin it for all you future prefrosh out there who might take the program when you come here! However, you can get a better idea of what we do in the program by taking a look at all the students' photos online here!  Great job DPD 2013 students! Thanks for making it our best year yet :)  In a nutshell or two: I'm a budding MechE, love building things, and like to pretend I can do a British accent.

If you lose control of your attitude, two things happen: (1) you start to tumble and spin, disorienting everyone on board, and (2) you start straying from your desired course. In short, controlling attitude is one of the most crucial parts of flying a spacecraft, which is why theyre equipped with suites of sensors and actuators dedicated to monitoring and adjusting orientation. Life at MIT isnt so different. You might get sick during finals week. You might have a midterm and 3 psets due on the same day. These are variables that you have little control over. What you do have control over is your attitude. Attitude is really important. Its what keeps you going through hell weeks, what keeps you going after you bomb a midterm, what keeps you hitting the books when all you want to do is sleep. Because if you don't maintain attitude, you'll be like that spacecraft tumbling out of control - going wherever life shoves you. *(Credit for this analogy goes to retired astronaut Chris Hadfield.  You should get his new book - it's really good!)   During my time at MIT so far, I've learned some valuable lessons about maintaining attitude: Most people go into MIT used to success.  Between hard work and natural ability, they've always been reasonably successful at most things they've put their minds to. And depending on your strengths, you might coast through a few semesters at MIT too.  But sooner or later, everyone hits a wall. One of the hardest things I've had to learn at MIT is: hitting a wall is okay!  Actually, it's great!  Because if you're not hitting walls, then you're not pushing yourself hard enough. Early success is a terrible teacher. Youre essentially being rewarded for a lack of preparation, so when you find yourself in a situation where you must prepare, you cant do it. You dont know how. Even the most gifted person in the world will at some point cross a threshold where its no longer possible to wing it. The volume of complex information and skills to be mastered is simply too great to be able to figure it all out on the fly. Some get to this break point and realize they cant continue to rely on raw talent they need to buckle down and study. Others never quite seem to figure that out and, in true tortoise-and-hare fashion, find themselves in a place they never expected to be: the back of the pack. They dont know how to push themselves to the point of discomfort and beyond. - Chris Hadfield If you're maintaining the right attitude, even the most excruciating failure can become a valuable asset.  I know from personal experience: I'm passionate about the intersection of engineering and design.  It's the reason I took 2.00B (Toy Product Design) last year, and also the reason why I made this giant Dieter Rams poster hanging on my wall:  I think there is a profound and enduring beauty in simplicity, in clarity, in efficiency. True simplicity is derived from so much more than just the absence of clutter and ornamentation. Its about bringing order to complexity. - Jony Ive To me, design is so much more than just the way something looks.  It shouldn't just be some aesthetic shell that you slap on after the engineering team has cobbled something together. True design is the very core of a product, which manifests itself in successive outer layers.  It's how the product works, how it feels in your hand, how it fits in the context of your life.  And the very best products come from places where engineering and design drive each other. Apple is probably the company that most embodies this design philosophy, which is why I've always dreamed of joining their Product Design group.   So in late September, when Apple recruiters visited MIT, I leapt at the chance.  My first casual interview went well, and I scheduled a second interview the very next day. I prepared, and prepared, and prepared.  I went to the career development office for mock interviews.  I obsessed over my resume in LaTeX.  I even timed the walk from campus to the coffeeshop where the interview would be to make sure I wouldn't be late.  This was my dream internship, seemingly within grasp. I bombed the interview. The behavioral portion of the interview went well enough, but most of the technical questions were on material in 2.001/2.002 (Mechanics and Materials) that we hadn't covered in class yet.  And so I stumbled, red-faced, through the questions - I'm still cringing at the memory.  (Specifically, I remember getting certain material characteristics of polycarbonate completely wrong, claiming that it's an ideal material for when scratch resistance is important - forgetting, of course, that polycarbonate actually has very low scratch-resistance and has to be coated to increase its durability.  Why do I still remember this?).   This sort of complete academic failure was new to me.  But as badly as the technical interview went, I chose to view it as a valuable learning experience - as a wakeup call. As the semester rolled on, I began recognizing the stuff we were learning in 2.001 from my interview - and you can bet that I learned that material extra well (in fact, I got my best test score this year on that section!). And a few weeks later, I got another email from Apple.  The iPad product design team wanted to set up another interview! This time, I was much better prepared.  I knew what to expect in interviews now; I knew what my weaknesses were.  And I solved the brain teasers reasonably well.  Results won't come out for a few weeks, but either way - I am satisfied that I did everything I possibly could to prepare, and therefore I am content. Failure has worked out pretty well in my favor.   If you go into MIT thinking that you'll major in whatever you find "interesting", you'll never get anywhere. It's like being a kid in a candy shop; very little work at MIT isn't interesting.  You've got to go beyond interest.  You have to find what truly excites and challenges you.  As Dropbox CEO Drew Houston told MIT in June:  When I think about it, the happiest and most successful people I know dont just love what they do, theyre obsessed with solving an important problem, something that matters to them. They remind me of a dog chasing a tennis ball: their eyes go a little crazy, the leash snaps and they go bounding off, plowing through whatever gets in the way... Its about finding your tennis ball, the thing that pulls you. It might take a while, but until you find it, keep listening for that little voice. You dont need to know exactly what your goal is - but you should have one. Every decision you make today turns you into who you are tomorrow, and the day after that - so you'd better have some end goal in sight.  Otherwise, you're just going through the motions. You probably won't end up exactly where you think you'll end up - who'd want the rest of their life perfectly planned out by an 18-year-old anyway? - but you will be doing things that excite you in something that matters to you. Having a concrete goal is the major reason this is the happiest I've ever been at MIT.  I'm taking classes that excite me, and I can see the direct utility in the material I'm learning (thanks, bombed interview) - and therefore I know I'm moving towards my desired goal. Find your tennis ball, and chase it.  Don't just go through the motions.   MIT is hard.  You know what's even harder?  Going through MIT alone. Office hours, recitations, upperclassmen, S^3.  These are all really valuable resources that I did not take full advantage of last year - out of some misguided sense of lone-wolf-ism, or something. But I've since realized that I lack the gene for masochism. You don't get extra credit for grinding through a pset alone for 3 hours, versus asking for help. There will always be people in your classes who brag about how they never have to study or go to recitations or lectures.  Ignore them. There is no shame in asking for help.  The only shame is in not getting where you wanted to go, because you were too afraid to ask for help. Fashion is, evidently, alive and thriving at MIT (we're not just a bunch of nerds who always wear hoodies and jeans!). Tonight, Kappa Alpha Theta hosted their annual fashion show, Katwalk, featuring clothing from both Boston professionals as well as MIT student (and alumni) designers. Now, fashion shows are amazing things if you're a photographer looking to become a better photographer, so I have a bunch of pictures for you guys! Also make sure to check out all the designers, because they're all pretty awesome. MIT designers: Romp Apparel Ministry of Supply 'e d i t' by Samantha D., '15 Preethi Vaidyanathan  Boston/professional designers: Kinda ToumaSookiHabitFree PeopleJanjiLF And now--the pictures! These are just my favorite photos and/or outfits from the fashion show. I'm personally a big fan of the red-grey-black color scheme, so this outfit from Sooki really caught my attention. And who doesn't love polka dots? Summery beach dresses from Romp Apparel made it feel--very briefly--warm in Boston again.  The MIT Logarhythms brought out their Sunday best to perform between showings. This is, of course, talking about a group that usually performs in snuggies and Waldo costumes (check them out at one of their previous performances here).     These girls are breaking it down in 'e d i t' by Samantha D., MIT Class of 2015, a series that takes cheap or old clothing from thrift stores and "edits" them to make something fresh. Check out her fashion Tumblr: dressmewoman.tumblr.com/   These marvelous pieces are from South Boston fashion line Habit. Again--loving the black and red color scheme.  Free People mixed it up with models that blew glitter into the crowd. Glitter. You can't not like glitter.      Free People also mixed it up with these really relaxed, striking-yet-casual outfits. Kind of...hippie-hipster? I like it.   Changing it up a little, we had a few pieces to preview the upcoming MIT Trashion Show on December 6--featuring "sustainable fashion made out of recycled goods." Admittedly, this is pretty classy for a vest made out of...looks like cardstock and magazine pages?   Taking another break from fashion, MIT's competitive hip-hop dance team RiDONKulous came out fists high and feet stomping. They're all crazy good dancers--that's about all I can say about them because it's something you have to see for yourself.    Janji makes running apparel with designs inspired by countries around the world, including Kenya, Haiti, Tanzania, Peru, Rwanda, Bangladesh, and our own United States. Here's the cool part--proceeds from clothing sales are actually donated to help that country in some area relating to water or malnutrition.     These sassy outfits come out of LF. If there's one thing I love, it's an outfit with an attitude.   I suppose that about wraps it up for this week!

I've blogged about teaching at these events before. A few weeks ago, I agreed to teach a class with my friend Davie '12: it's called "Spontaneous 5-Minute Classes on Whatever You Want," and here's the course description: "You choose the title, we improvise a 5-minute lesson on it! Bring your wackiest topic suggestions, and watch us embarrass ourselves as we teach you about them on the spur of the moment." Every time I re-read that, I wonder what possessed me to agree to do this.  To practice, I e-mailed French House to ask for sample prompts. Every night, I randomly pull up three of these prompts randomly, to practice the process of "WHAT???? HOW DID SOMEONE EVEN COME UP WITH THIS???"-->"I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT THIS"-->"Well, I guess I know a LITTLE bit about something tangentially related to this"-->"Okay, I have an idea for how to begin, at least"-->five minutes of improv. The prompts I received were so good that I can't resist sharing. If you decide to get up and practice improvising 5-minute classes on these topics, I would love to know what techniques you used / what you said / how you dealt with topics that you really know nothing whatsoever about.

My neighbors are members of concert choir and the chamber chorus. I'm also an Arts Scholar, which means that I get to go listen to concerts in Boston for free.  In other words: I've had a lot of exposure to music composed between 1600-1800. I've listened to, or played, music by Monteverdi and Hayden and Mozart and Bach and Handel and Haydn.  But I've never studied it. I am completely aware (and a bit embarrassed) that if you pinned me against a wall, forced an earbud into my external auditory meatus, hit "play" on your iPod, and yelled WHO COMPOSED THIS PIECE OF 1600-1800 MUSIC ?!?! I wouldn't be able to answer unless I actually knew the song. I certainly wouldn't be able to say "ah, well, I hear this technique and that technique, so it must be Mozart." I couldn't tell you off the top of my head how to distinguish between any of the composers I just listed above. And at a concert, I think the most intelligent thing I could say is "ah, that's pretty!" (There's nothing wrong with saying a piece is pretty -- but I've always wished that I could say more. I'd like to recognize the techniques and characteristics that make a piece distinct.) 21M.235 ("Monteverdi to Mozart: 1600-1800") is part of a 4-class series: 21M.220 Early Music (early Middle Ages until the end of the Renaissance), 21M.235 Monteverdi to Mozart (1600-1800), 21M.250 Beethoven to Mahler (1800-1910), and 21M.260 Stravinsky to the Present.  If I had my way, I'd take all of them as a grand tour through the highlights of western music. My senior year of high school, one of my favorite classes (if not my favorite class) was AP Art History, which was super hard but made me a much happier human being. Buildings looked familiar! They had characteristics I could recognize and identify with a particular movement or location or time period. It's like learning to recognize the constellations and their mythological stories: everywhere you go, you see familiar friendly faces that you can say something about, and which recall stories.  If I had my way. But class time at MIT is limited, and it's too late for me to take all of those classes. So I'll have to settle with 21M.235 this semester, and maybe 21M.250 next semester. By the way, I should mention that 21M.235 is a HASS-A. MIT's HASS requirement means that, on average, every student needs to take one humanities, arts, or social sciences class per semester. The requirement addresses depth (each student must fulfill a concentration) as well as breadth (each student must take one "Arts" class, designated HASS-A, one "Humanities" class, designated HASS-H, and one "Social Science" class, designated HASS-S). Three highlights from the class so far: 1) Playing the organ in Kresge Auditorium 2) Playing a harpsichord 3) Showing off by taking a test *     *     * 1) Playing the organ in Kresge Auditorium This is not a performance class, but most of my classmates are musicians, which isn't surprising for any class of MIT students, much less for a class that has music-reading ability as a prerequisite. This class trains us to listen to a piece of music, and discuss it in many dimensions. One of the most obvious dimensions - so obvious I usually forget about it - is the instrument the piece was written for. The harpsichord, for example, cannot sustain a note. You hit a key, it goes "bing!" and that's it. A note is a binary thing: it's "on", or it's "off." It doesn't make sense to talk about dynamics. In total contrast, the piano can sustain notes, and how hard you press is correlated to how loud the sound is. This completely changes the set of effects you can achieve through writing notes on a page.  Professor Neff is very fond of organ music, so during Week II of class ("Organ Music, Oratorio and Cantata") she took us to MIT's Kresge Auditorium and played the organ for us.  Here's a picture of the Kresge organ:  It was built in the 1950s; the largest of the silver tubes is 32 feet long (THIRTY TWO FEET LONG. THIRTY TWO!) and the shortest ones are six inches long. It's hard to tell from the picture, but there are wooden flaps (called slats) against the wall behind the organ. The organist uses a pedal to control whether these flaps are open or closed, and in so doing controls the color of the sound. The organ is off to the side of the auditorium, at the front near the stage, and air is pushed through the pipes using an electric motor. In a Baroque church, the organ would have been at the back, and an instrument this size would have required 6-10 small children to essentially run on a 17th century Stairmaster to keep air flowing through the pipes -- this made achieving a consistent sound really hard.  Prof. Neff led us up through a narrow stairwell to the organ. I sat down, and played a few chords. It was very empowering. Views from the organ:       If you want the privilege of an expertly-guided tour of Kresge's organ, I strongly suggest taking 21M.235. 2) Playing a harpsichord One class, Prof. Neff brought in an internationally-renowned French Horn & harpsichord player. We spent the hour and a half class block with her in Killian Auditorium. She alternated between talking about the history of harpsichords, and performing for us. I don't think I'd ever actually witnessed someone playing the harpsichord; I've just seen harpsichords in museums.  There are references to harpsichords in records dating as early as 1397. It rose to popularity in the 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries, and died out around 1812. There exists, however, a small and tight-knit international community of harpsichord enthusiasts: our guest's teacher actually re-quills his harpsichords by hand, which involves cutting up goose feathers and trimming them to exactly the right size. An expert named Mark Lindley has a website about harpsichord temperaments (methods of tuning) - he travels the world and crashes with lots of harpsichordists.  "If you want to build harpsichords," she said, "you have to be pretty OCD." She told us that a couple of years ago there was an MIT student who spent a lot of time in the Hobby Shop building a harpsichord; not sure what came of that project.  MIT has three harpsichords on campus. There's an Italian, which we purchased in 2011 but which was ruined by water a month ago. There's a single French in 4-364 (a classroom) and a double French, which is the one we were playing with in Killian Auditorium. If you want to become a harpsichord master, come to Boston, because "we are very lucky in Boston to have a world-renowned keyboard-restorer". Someone at BU leaned on an instrument and it fell to the floor and shattered into a million pieces, but this keyboard-restorer put it back together. Those crazy BU kids. Our guest began in England with William Byrd. He was extremely skilled and popular, so he got to be 1) Catholic and 2) survive, no mean feat for someone living in England around 1600. She played a piece that people would sing while an unfortunate individual was being led to the gallows, and I admit that the context makes it difficult to store the piece in my cabinet of "Fond Memories". Without knowing the context, though, I thought it was beautiful. Unfortunately, we didn't spend long in England, and moved right along to Italy. She played two toccatas by Frescobaldi, who was slightly younger than Byrd and a star all over Europe. Personally, I way preferred the Byrd, which is possibly my nine-years-living-in-England speaking but more likely just the fact that Frescobaldi's music has no obvious organization to it. It was supposed to be very improvisatory, and the sections of the piece operate completely independently of each other. Directionless music makes hard listening.  From Italy, we went to France: Meditation sur ma morte future by Froburger (if you don't know French, that title means: "meditation on my future death". Cheerful stuff!), a wild piece whose title I failed to write down, a chaconne by Louis Couprin, and an unmeasured prelude by Elizabeth Jacquet de la Guerre. The score of the wild Couprin piece made a strong impression on me (she showed us the original score) -- it looked like Couprin wrote a whole bunch of whole notes down (each note was represented by an empty circle) then tried to play connect the dots between the staffs. There were manic arcs from each note up to a note on a higher staff. Very bizarre. If someone handed me that to play, I would start banging my fists on the keyboard.  We also learned that one can purchase a little "apartment" harpsichord: the harpsichord equivalent of an upright piano. Tempting! Dorm room accessory, anyone?  3) Showing off by taking a test Tests in this class consist of 3 sections: (1) Defining vocabulary terms, (2) Identifying a piece & composer & genre by listening to a 30-45 second segment, (3) Writing a short essay. Professor Neff is kind enough to provide us with all the possibilities beforehand, so it's a matter of systematically going through the study guide and achieving familiarity with everything on it. For those interested or particularly musically inclined, below is the study guide for our most recent exam: Terms: Henry Purcell: George Frideric Handel Johann Sebastian Bach Vivaldi Domenico Scarlatti C.P.E. Bach Possibilities for essay prompts: It is so. cool. to look over a study sheet and realize that you could define any of those terms, recognize any of those pieces, and write a paragraph or two in response to any of those essay prompts. Particularly when you started the semester unsure if you could name a five pieces composed between 1600 and 1800. And particularly when you're majoring in physics and minoring in astronomy, plan to go onto graduate school in astrophysics, and realize that the opportunity to become versed in Baroque classical music is very precious indeed. 11/9/2013: At the time of this writing: > I'm sitting in a cozy joint titled "Tasty Burger" with Hairuo, Royal, and Trevor. (They're cool.)> Hairuo, Royal, and Trevor are telling me I should double major in Comparative Media Studies. I'm kind of considering it.> I have yet to see if the burgers are tasty.> "The Fox" is playing on the speakers. Loudly.> I ordered an apple juice box which I have just finished.> There is an amazing mural on the wall of Samuel L. Jackson from Pulp Fiction.  This marks the end of a very good start to what will be a very good weekend. First and most importantly, I got nine hours of sleep last night, which I haven't been able to do for a while. If there's one thing I've learned since coming here, it's that sleep is very, very, VERY valuable to me, and I have to work hard to make sure I get enough of it. Burgers are here. The story continues...later!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------11/10/2013: The burgers were fairly tasty. On a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 would be a high school cafeteria burger and 5 would be an In-N-Out double-double, Tasty Burger would fall in the 4 to 4.5 range. In any case. This weekend is particularly splendid for a couple of reasons. First of all, it's a long weekend. Second of all, I painted figurative rainbows all over my second 8.022 (Introductory Physics Electricity/Magnetism, hard mode) exam last Thursday after getting 9 hours of sleep on a weeknight, which ended up being much better for my test than studying for it. This means a weekend usually spent on 8.022 psets was spent instead catching up on sleep and singing with the Toons. Which brings me to the third reason: two (TWO) performances with my a cappella group, the MIT-Wellesley Toons, whom I dearly love. Look, we're on the Internet and everything. Here's a video from our last performance a few weeks ago. We did a small performance on Friday night at Wellesley, but it was our Saturday evening concert that we'd been preparing for the most. Saturday night was the Eighth Annual MIT-Wellesley Toons Concert for a Cure, a benefit concert for multiple sclerosis which featured not only the Toons but also a ton of amazing groups from other places like Harvard, Olin, Suffolk, and Wellesley. We had too much fun turning the lecture hall 10-250 into a makeshift concert venue by covering the blackboards with silly chalk art and dressing up in official "Tooniforms": black shirt, black pants, and colored ties for the guys, and colored shirts with suspenders for the gals.  Meet the Olin Powerchords. They're pretty kick-ass. They shot one of their members on stage at the end of their set, cutting off their last song. Not even kidding--it was a song from a James Bond movie and they ended it by shooting the lead singer with a Nerf pistol.  These delightful fellows are Roadkill Buffet, MIT's very own improv comedy group. They took the prompt "pickles" and turned it into a ten-minute series of skits featuring the benefits of veganism and eating organic, the need to wear furry boots, a farmer who can't bear to slaughter his cows for food, and a pastor who hears the cows' confession of being able to talk. Comedy sure doesn't make much sense, but that's what makes it hilarious.  The Wellesley Tupelos came out and rocked the show. They're named after Wellesley's Tupelo Point. It's said that if you kiss your significant other there, you'll get married to them (or be successful and wealthy in life, depending on which version you subscribe to).  The Harvard Dance Team came out with a performance set to Lady Gaga's "Applause." They were pretty great. Major props for being able to do a full performance in a lecture hall without knocking anything down.  Toons getting pumped right before the show!  Some of the other groups who came out included the a cappella groups the Suffolk Ramifications, Harvard Mirch (East Asian/pop mashup a cappella!), Wellesley Dead Serious (more improv comedy), Wellesley Freestyle (daaaance). It was awesome and amazing and we raised a couple hundred dollars for finding a cure for multiple sclerosis.

It had its several current peaks and rocky outbursts, challenges I found myself learning to deal with as time fled. I was part of the schools ultra-small math olympiad class, and spent a significant number of hours outside my normal classes dealing with things like geometric invariants, number theory and unruly combinatorics problems. In eleventh grade, a sort of climax emerged. I was on the path to being part of Nigerias International Mathematics Olympiad team, and if I wanted to turn probability into certainty, I had to make a few sacrifices. Specifically, I was allowed into a program of learning that swapped two-seventh of my regular classes with olympiad classes, but I use swapped here very loosely. I would still receive grades for the regular classes I was missing, and needed to make up for them in what little free time I had. It was my most stressful high school semester, a stormy set of months that found me working past midnight on most nights trying to finish up difficult olympiad problems while trying to catch up on voluminous notes from regular classes. I barely made an A at the end of the semester, a grade that was necessary if I wanted to remain on scholarship. Looking back on this memory, I realize I had thought it had been one of those sappy, happy tales of triumphout of the roaring flames come the strongest steel. Out of the difficult semester had come a sense of time management and prioritization-skill that would let me handle anything thrown my way. Last week, MIT laughed at this happy ending and tore it to pieces. There was still a lot I had to learn. Many MIT students you talk to will understand a distinct transition from high school to the Institute. Theyll recognize that while high school might have been anywhere from easy sailing to a fairly time-consuming cross-country race, MIT morphed into this full-blown restless marathon that demanded more energy than you might have ever thought necessary. The most difficult of problem sets will consume your time, sometimes without any clear results; midterm results will strip you of the pride-laden identity of being on top that might have defined your high school years. Youll work hard, really hard, but you can get used to it; youll strike this balance between work and relaxation that will make you love MIT and appreciate work. I thought Id found this balance, up until last week. Last week, I had two midterms and two p-sets. Normally, this should have been a stressful weekarent most weeks herebut not enough to warrant this much reflection. The reason the week sent me buckling to my knees with more force than was needed was because I still lacked somethingbalance, time-management, something. In my first few weeks here, I got a fair taste of how much time my classes demanded. I could expect to expend between five to eight hours on every problem set or paper, and a little more outside of that doing some additional studying. I could expect to start a problem set on Tuesday afternoon and get done by midnight with a few breaks in between. Once or twice, thered be a super-weird p-set that demanded just a bit more time, but for the most part, I had figured out how the system of the first semester worked for me, and I had adjusted to it. Then boom. Monday Afternoon. I studied my schedule and realized I had a physics p-set due and a bio midterm on Wednesday. I spent the rest of Monday studying for the midterm, and realized that somehow, things were getting out of my grip. Somehow, the material I needed to understand seemed to have quadrupled in the space of no time, and I felt that I really needed a lot more time if I was to do half-decently on the midterm. I tried old problem sets and exams, but they just consumed time horrendously while leaving me half-confused. I was mixing up similar ideas for similar concepts, and it was around three a.m. on a Tuesday morning when, weak-eyed and drained, I told myself that I had an entire day ahead of me, enough time to figure out whatever was going on in these suddenly mysterious tales of protein localization and restriction enzymes. Tuesday morning slid along. I was reluctant to get up from bedI always am, reallybut I managed to...after shutting off three consecutive alarms. Classes rolled along from noon to five p.m., and I got back to my room feeling somewhat disoriented. For some reason, I really wanted to sleep again...but I did have a midterm the next day and a p-set due. It was barely dark yet. I still had time. I watched a few videos from MITs OpenCourseWare site, which hosts an infinite collection of past lectures, and tried to sort through my Biology notes. I spent a good while going through them, often pausing to remark at how awful my diagrams were, and took a break only when my stomach began growling. I needed food. I had dinner and returned to work. After shifting through several pages of detail and pictures, I tried online problem sets from edX, an online educational resource. There...there was still something wrong. For the most part, I felt as though I had a good grasp on the general concepts, but when I faced problems, similar ideas to tackle them swam to the forefront of my mind, but I knew that the contrast in those ideas made the difference between a correct and an incorrect answer, and I had somehow turned all the relevant information into a sludge of concepts I could barely distinguish. Was polyadenylation for eukaryotic DNA templates or prokayortic ones? Was a distinction made between the two? I couldnt remember. I did a few practice exams. You need to understand these things just a bit more, they seemed to smugly suggest. You need to sleep, my roommate told me. He had just finished up a p-set and was wrapping himself under a snug blanket. Its late...youll do fine. Soon... I mumbled wearily to him. Ill be fine...just a little more time...trying to understand whats going on... It was close to three a.m. when I slept, waking up six hours later to prepare for the midterm. The midterm threw questions at me that tried to navigate the frenzied tangle of details my frayed mind held, searching for what fit where. Time flew with rude speed; next thing, I knew, time was up, and I hadnt even finished. That didnt go well at all, I thought dispiritedly to myself. Just before my final Wednesday classP.E. RunningI went to the student center, bought a sandwich and stared at the physics problem set. My mind felt far out of a thinking mood, and I didnt want to brood over problems right now. I just wanted to...to brood. Minutes later, I was running laps round an indoor track, feeling tired and dehydrated way too early into the class. By the time the class ended, my heart was thudding out of control. My head was spinning. Woozy, weary, I trudged back to my dorm, which felt all too far, wishing I could teleport, wishing I was better at Biology, wishing I could have a cold glass of water at the moment. My legs quavered when I got to my dorm. I collapsed on my bed, keeping in mind to rest for a few minutes and start on my physics p-set which was due in a few hours. A couple of hours later, I rose out of an unwilling slumber. The first thought that popped into my head of course was my physics p-set. Due...due in four hours. I had barely even started. I was absolutely mortified. Oh God, I whispered to myself. Quickly, I grabbed a stack of A4 papers and began the problem set. My mind churned out chaotic thoughts. I wont be able to finish this...should I ask for an extension? No...no, I just...I just have to see how far I can go. Diagrams. Arrows. Fruitless ideas. Crossed-out equations. Unclear physical systems. Illogical pictures. Is this even possible? I made my way to the central lounge on my floor with a bunch of papers, asked people a few questions, got some details clarified, and headed back to my room to continue the p-set. I managed to finish, turning it in with less than five minutes to spare. Whats going on this week? I thought to myself. My roommate told me to try and relax. Maybe later, I told him. Still have a few things to do. I was about to start on my calculus p-set, but on a whim, I checked my online gradebook for the Intro Bio. Midterm grades were out. I had gotten a C. -- When I began the calculus p-set that Wednesday night, I realized something was wrongmy pattern...my pattern of five-to-eight hours for p-sets wouldnt hold for this one. It was going to be a lot longer. The problems were significantly more complex, and the material had gotten a lot more unfamiliar. I worked on everything till slightly past midnight, and feeling deeply frustrated with how the whole day had gone, slept earlier than I usually would have. Thursday morning turned to noon. Classes came and went. I worked on the p-set, but there seemed to be a dispirited laziness in the way I approached the problems. My thoughts seemed to be drifting through a cycle of thinking about what to do and just thinking about why this week felt so awful, as if I was being plunged around the air like a slam-dunked basketball. This led to a not-very-speedy p-setting experience, and I stopped three-quarters of the way through, because it was already late and I needed to study for my physics midterm which was the next morning. I made my way through the preparatory practice problems the class had been e-mailed, and maybe for the first time that week, felt a strong glimmer of hope. I actually seemed to have a fair enough grip on the concepts of elastic collisions and energy to understand what was going on in those problems. I still ended up sleeping late, with the clock ticking its way to four a.m., waking up an hour before the midterm. The midterm went alright. It probably could have gone better, but I definitely felt that it had gone a lot more nicely than Intro Bio had. I made a bit more progress on the calculus p-set, and turned it in after having lunch with a friend. After my last Friday class, I felt very, very happy. A crazy week was over, and I had arranged to talk with my family. I spent two hours Skyping with my mom and siblings, and an hour afterwards talking with my dad on the phone. I was happy to see their smiling faces and hear their strong, soothing voices. The cheerfulness lasted the rest of the weekend. -- I definitely understand that the past week could have gone a lot better if Id done things a bit differently. Its clear that sometimes, the workload at MIT gets particularly intense, possibly at instances when other personal situations are cutting their way through life, but the problem this past week hadnt really been from the workload. It had been from my approach, my mindset. I thought a lot about what I could have done to make things better, to make studying for biology a lot more streamlined, to fit my p-setting and studying for midterms into a more seamless pattern, and the answers werent far from grasp. Firstly, MIT might be a restless marathon, but it wasnt a one-person mission. I had approached studying for the Bio midterm as though I were the only student in the class. There had obviously been concepts I had not fully understood, ideas that had kept getting mixed up, but I had made it seem as though it were my job, and my job alone, to figure out what was what, and why. I had extremely knowledgeable friends at Random Hall and in Concourse, Biology-loving brothers in ADPhi, teaching assistants with wide-ranging office hours. I could have turned to them for help. They could have provided insight my buzzing mind was missing. I chose the solitary road at a time I most needed the expertise of others around methe expertise in particular that makes MIT one of the most fulfilling places to learn in, and ended up performing not as well as I otherwise might have. In contrast, I had been able to get my physics p-set done in time only after I had asked for help. Getting help is important here, and it might be easier on your nerves to understand this on a practical level before MIT puts on its boxing gloves and wearily shows you this the hard way. -- I had also not given myself much leeway in terms of proactivity. I could have started my physics or calculus p-set earlier than Monday afternoon, but my original idea that everything could fit into manageable chunks of time had prevented me from doing so. Problems arent always fluid or predictable, neither in MIT nor in real life. Cruising through this week of p-sets in no way guaranteed that something about next weeks material wouldnt be less intuitive, more unclear, more time-consuming. Recognizing that MIT can get quite difficult, that classes race by, translates to a need for strong time-management that prevents work from somehow distilling into this impossibly tiny time slot that will churn your time and energy away like the hungry ghosts of Pacman. It translates to a need for balance. A lifetime ago, in high school, I thought I had achieved this balance. Turns out I was wrong. Im still learning how to build effective study habits, how to manage my time, and the past week taught me a lot, about collaboration, about seeking assistance, about trying to attain an equilibrium that lets me understand that getting a good amount of sleep doesnt come at the price of falling behind on work, and vice versa. I guess thats what this freshman semester of Pass-No-Record is all about, this self-discovery. Im grateful the challenges of the previous week pushed me one step closer into ensuring I minimize the hectic nature of my time here. Well see how it goes, but right now, Im pretty optimistic. This semester has definitely been a rough one, especially around this time of the year.  Flags for classes are being handed out for those of us who are struggling extraordinarily well, and some of us (at least I hope it's not just me) are staying up way too late to finish projects and do work at the loss of self-care and health.  However, amidst the chaos of classes and ridiculous amount of stress bestowed among the students here at MIT, some of the students decided that they felt particularly passionate about an event that occured on Friday. This past Friday, the First of November, was the release of the movie associated with the Ender's Game series by Orson Scott Card.  Unlike many of the MIT students that I know, I have not read the series, but I am aware that this movie is supposed to be really great and that it was going to be out in theaters sometime soon.  Therefore, on my way to get Frozen Yogurt on Saturday, I was super excited and impressed to find Killian Court decorated with beautiful banners, showcasing the different armies of Ender's Game - Griffin, Dragon, and Tiger.  Photos taken by Hairuo G. '17 As my friend Lauren S. '16 and I continued on our way to get Frozen Yogurt, we came across the actual battle scene in Lobby 7, and it was incredible.   Photos taken by Hairuo G. '17 As you can see, the area in Lobby 7 that was normally cut off due to the construction being done on the skylight of the Lobby 7 dome was cautioned off from the public due to a battle scene between the different armies, with soldiers all over Lobby 7.  They were hung from the ceiling, suspended over the construction zone and spread out over the floor and on the pedestals.  It was beautifully organized and very well put together! I love waking up in the morning after a terribly stressful week to a new hack by MIT students.  Sometimes MIT can seem like a really terrible place, but taking a look at this remarkable piece of artwork strategically placed around campus reminds me that this is where I belong, among the crazy people who come up with these awesome ideas, and that I really do look forward to staying here through the next three years. Also, MIT lets us have stress-relieving mice-catching cats!  The leaves are falling like snowflakes and sometimes when the sun hits the trees just right, the Massachusetts landscape burns golden. The fabled season of fall has arrived in all of its deciduous glory and is currently running around giving everyone chilly hugs. Ive lived in Southern California for ten years now, but unlike other sun-loving transplants, I consider the brisk weather a welcome change. My impressions of fall, in the absence of any real comparable seasonal changes, are idealized and heavily informed by cheesy holiday movies and distant memories of childhood days spent frolicking in Indiana. When I think fall, I think piles of crunchy, crispy leaves ripe for the leaping, apple picking, cinnamon and nutmeg sunshine, crackling fireplaces, and pie. Mmm, pie.  Here is a picture of pie I found on the internet for all you visual learners out there. Two weeks ago, four or five buses wound their way down 30 miles of tree-lined asphalt to Honey Pot Hills Orchards. Laden with sleepy MIT students, the buses arrived in a cloud of dust and we stormed the orchard, wielding plastic bags and enthusiasm. It was like we had found a way to bottle the effervescence of autumn in just one day.  Photo credits to Elisa '17. Thanks for letting me use your beautiful masterpieces! After munching on cider donuts and a bottle of apple cider, we sat down between the animal pens and the pumpkin patch, breathing in the smell of falling leaves and listening to the sounds of laughter. Away from psets, exams, and the confines of dormitory walls, I could feel the last bits of summer peeling away, like a banana, or a skintight jumpsuit.  The main attraction, of course, was apple picking. One hayride later, we were dropped off amidst the sprawling rows of trees heavy with fruits. Before we began hoarding apples left and right, we took a crash course in apple picking courtesy of the internet. The proper technique, apparently, involves consideration of the color, firmness, and age of each apple. Not particularly interested in perfecting my apple picking skills, I stuck with my own improvised method. I call it the tickle test: Step 1: Tickle the apple.- If the apple has fallen, congratulations! You are the proud parent of a ripe apple.- If the apple has not fallen, repeat step 1 on a different, hopefully more ticklish apple. We clambered up rickety ladders wedged between branches, scaled tree trunks, and hung from branches, channeling our inner three-toed sloths. Along the way, we polished a few apples with un-tucked shirt ends and devoured them. Despite the rampant snacking, our bags were filled to the brim in no time and we headed back to the buses, sad to be leaving the crimson yellow landscape.  Look! Rita is a sloth! Theres no doubt that we are firmly rooted in fall now. Another summer has come and gone and there are only a few more months until winter pokes its head around the corner. Some branches are already entirely bare, perfect for Halloween spookiness, but less ideal for providing shade or general leafy pleasantness. Which I guess is pretty hard to do if you dont have any actual leaves. Even the Johnson athletic center has already been transformed into an ice skating rink. I used to take ice skating lessons in Indiana, but all I can remember is how to lace up my skates and how to fall. Im probably an expert at falling down, so if you need any tips or pointers on how to be clumsier, Id be more than willing to help. The ice rink is opened to the students for free during Spookyskate, SaveTFPs annual Halloween event, where students can dress up, eat cookies and candy, and skate to their hearts content. Like a seasoned ice skater, I spent about an hour hobbling around the edge of the rink, gripping the side walls and shuffling one foot after the other. Finally, after mustering up the courage, I broke free and sailed across the ice like a majestic whale breaching the water for the first time. The sailing deteriorated rapidly into flailing and eventually into tumbling. I no longer felt like a majestic whale. But I picked myself up, brushed off the ice shards on my pants, and resumed skating. Now I have a nifty bruise on my knee as a souvenir but absolutely no regrets. Sometimes it feels like time is slipping away, like we are always moving from one moment to the next and theres never time to stop, breathe, and just look around. College is often considered one of lifes greatest transitions, and in many ways, it is. We leave our old homes, parents, and friends to come to a new place where we have to learn to rely on ourselves. Part of the experience is making new friends and finding a way to call this strange new place home. I feel lucky to be living in a place where I feel like I belong. Even though things are constantly changing around me, I have not once felt unwelcome. Im not saying I dont miss my family and my home, because I do. But after only two months here, Im already starting to call MIT my home as well. Life is just a series of never ending transitions and I think Ive learned that sometimes, we can get lost looking into the future. I dont want to live through fall just waiting for summer to turn into winter. I want to invite fall into my humble dorm room, make it a steaming mug of apple cider, and tell it stories about my two cats back home. What Im trying to say is, its important to slow down and enjoy the moment. While I look forward to wintery whiteness, right now, Im enjoying all the crunchiness and crispness of fall. Weve already taken two out of four tests in each of my GIRs and have officially passed the halfway mark. Soon freshman fall and the ever gracious pass/no record will be a distant memory. At the orchards, three of us wandered through a mini monster hedge maze with towering green shrubbery and only the sounds of other peoples laughter guiding us towards the center. After quite a few wrong turns, we made it triumphantly to the middle flag.  Even the backs of our heads look befuddled. I could compare pretty much anything to a maze and it would work. Freshman year. Life. Problem number 5 on my last chemistry pset. Mazes are pretty versatile metaphors. I have decided to embrace the cheesiness and cliched nature of this metaphor and leave you with these little pearls of wisdom: *Deepest thanks to Winston Churchill, Dory, and Cady Heron for letting me use their beautiful words. Really, it means a lot to me. I just hope that by the end of our four years here, or by the end of any of our future endeavors, we will look as happy and accomplished as we did that day.  You see, the thing about Halloween is that it gives you a reason to act like you're in elementary school again. You wanna become Doctor Who? Go ahead. You wanna go to class as a princess? No problem. Go trick-or-treating and mooch candy from all your GRTs? Aww yes. I, for one, opted for going to class as a princess. Let me explain. I'm a fan of the TV show My Little Pony. That makes me solidly a member of that group of fans called "bronies," generously defined by Urban Dictionary as: That's actually one of the best definitions I've seen. The brony fanbase is arguably one of the most accepting social groups in existence, and seeing as the fanbase subscribes to a TV show that not only teaches fundamental values (the tagline is "Friendship is Magic," for goodness' sake) but does so in a witty, artful, and interesting way with well-developed and dimensional female characters. The animators and writers also throw in nods to our fanbase--check out these background characters:     That's right: meet, from left to right, "Doctor Whooves," and The Dude, Donny, and Walter Sobchak from The Big Lebowski. In any case, I decided to become Princess Luna, one of the pony royalty of the world of Equestria. As her name suggests, she's patron of the moon and the night, and has some fascinating backstory that I won't spoil for you because I know you're going to go and watch MLP to find out for yourself ;) Doing a humanized (or "gijinka") and male (or "crossplay") costume of Princess Luna is an idea I've been developing since maybe junior year of high school. Here's my original concept, and a picture of the character for comparison.    To really bring this to life, however, was a different story. I didn't want to permanently modify my clothes, for instance--I'd never have another use for a tie with Luna's cutie mark on it or a pair of jeans with a moon insignia. I also wanted the costume to be comfortable and fairly practical, and I wasn't sure I was up for dealing with a cape for an entire day of classes. I opted for painting a moon on a hankerchief instead, as well as exchanging the more formal tie-and-vest combo with a more streetwear-style denim jacket and v-neck tee. After scrounging around for supplies, I set to spray-painting. Spray paint with stencils, by the way, is possibly one of my favorite tools to use. It's delightfully messy, not very time consuming, and yields a nice, starry, splattery effect that can't quite be duplicated otherwise. Here are the t-shirt and hankerchief after painting:     And the final costume:   General post-Halloween thoughts about the costume: And another thing. Some of my friends decided the outfit needed a touch of eyeliner guyliner. This happened.  Sorry-not-sorry for the selfie.   Your friend in bronydom, Allan  Happy (belated) Halloween! Although I guess it's November now but let's ignore that. This is gonna be a quick post mainly because I half-promised pictures of my friends and I being all dorky and appreciative of Doctor Who, and I still have some other work to finish before sleeping. For the holiday, the MacGregor GRTs--Graduate students who are essentially MIT's equivalent of Residential Advisors--housemasters, and associate housemasters handed out treats to anyone who stopped by their rooms/apartments between 9-10pm. There were fruit roll-ups, mud cups, cookies shaped like fingers, chocolate covered strawberries, and, of course, mini variety packs of candy. And my friends and I took this opportunity to galavant around our dorm dressed up as a motley crew of 7 characters from Doctor Who... plus a Spaceman Spiff, Finn from Adventure Time, a gypsy/Peruvian, and a MIT student (ooh, scary). Our group was very all-inclusive. Anyway, for anyone who is interested, here are some candid shots and group photos of us looking both awesome and silly in front of a TARDIS poster imported from Ukraine (or some other exotic locale that has merchants on Amazon.com). Photocreds to Tobi R. '16 aka our River Song :)      (But actually I have a half-unfinished PSET due at 11:45am tomorrow and should probably go without rambling too much. Hope everyone had a wonderful holiday or will be able to take a break this weekend to watch scary movies or dress up for the heck of it or binge eat candy or healthy alternatives like apples and such. Very spoopy, much creppy.)  You: Where are you from?Me: London.You: But you...you don't...you don't seem to have a British accent.Me: Correct. Let me explain!

(Sidenote: a fun consequence of having a Halloween birthday is that whenever you go to the doctor's office and state your birth date, the nurse/doctor/receptionist says WOW!!! YOU'RE A HALLOWEEN BABY?? SO'S MY (sister/brother/cousin/friend/aunt/nephew/arch nemesis/husband/estranged son-in-law/daughter/stepson). Everyone seems to know one Halloween baby.) 31 October 2013 9:10am - My Bed Wake up, open computer. Facebook notifications up the wazoo. 7:13pm - My Floor I went out to lunch at a Japanese restaurant with Cam '13. Om nom nom:   The staff got wind that it was my birthday, so this arrived after the check:  After lunch, I had Pistol PE class. Mike Conti (the instructor, and author of this) gave us a talk on gun safety.  After Pistol, I booked it over to Harvard Square, where Davie '12 and I went to an exhibit about using toys to communicate basic science concepts. The exhibit took up one room, and we were the only people there -- I liked that, because it felt like I had my own set of toys that I could play with at my leisure. Can anyone PLEASE explain to me how this works?   Another highlight:   More science:   And some shenanigans:   2am - My Room At around 11:50pm, Sarah '17 knocked on my door to give me "a tour of French House" (because I need one after living here for three years). She took me to the Maisonette, then back to my room, then to the kitchen, where people were waiting in the dark...  As I rounded the corner, someone hopped out and stuck a hat on my head. French House sang Joyeux Anniversaire, and dark chocolate lava cake was enjoyed by all.   Afterwards, Sophie '14 led me to her room, where the other 2014s were waiting with a bottle of wine. We toasted, and I had a small (LEGAL!) drink.  Thank you for all the birthday wishes, everyone! <3 30 October 2013 8:40am - The French House kitchen Pre-exam breakfast of champions: a piece of toast, a bowl of chocolate frozen yoghurt, and a banana. 10am - 26-100 7.012 (Intro Bio) exam. It was long, and that's all I really have to say about it. 11am - 4-152 21M.235 (Monteverdi to Mozart) class. We discussed the score of a Bach French suite (No. 5 in G) then listened to the piece. A suite is a collection of dances -- to listen to, though, not to actually dance to. The No. 5 in G has an allemande, a courante, a sarabande, a gavotte, and a gigue. (Gigue is now one of my favorite French words.) Between each movement, there is a switch in character, and the G major triad is outlined by the first note of each movement. Also, Bach "is nothing but contrapuntal." Then, we moved onto a Scarlatti keyboard piece (K. 264 -- the K number is important because, in my music prof's words, "I can't tell you how many Sonatas in E there are"). For our purposes, this piece represents a shift from the Baroque concept of a keyboard piece (represented by the suite) to a single-movement work. This is the beginning of what we call the "sonata" form of the late 18th century. Scarlatti's piece was intended for courtly entertainment; in contrast, Bach's piece was intended for keyboard pedagogy. Finally, we listened to the Sonata in F Major ("Prussian" 1) by Bach's son Carl Philipp Emanuel (CPE Bach). The so-called "Prussian" sonatas were all written for Frederick the Great, who CPE worked for. We listened to a clavichord recording of the piece; at the end, the clavichordist (clavichordist?) played a lovely cadenza. Fun fact: CPE's treatise on keyboard playing was one of the first books devored by a young Hayden, while he taught himself to be a composer. 12:35pm - A bench at the intersection of Building 1 and the infinite corridor. I bought a box of salmon/avocado sushi, a bottle of "mighty mango" Naked juice smoothie, and made camp at one of the busiest places on MIT campus. I'm LaTeXing the Quantum II professor's handwritten course notes, as part of my quantum rehab program. I like working when there are strangers frantically speedwalking past me; it's both energing and non-distracting, because I don't know any of these people. 12:45pm - Just kidding. My friend Sam '14 appeared, looking for a place to crank out 20 minutes' worth of a pset. I offered him the spot next to me, so now I have company :) 12:50pm - I lied about being surrounded by strangers. My friend Davie '12 just appeared, also en route to finding a place to pset. While giving me a very energetic hug, his bike helmet clattered to the ground. He actually picked me up during the hug, which is no mean feat; I hope his back is okay. 12:51pm - Back to work. 2:43pm - 6-120 8.033 lecture! Transcribing what Prof. Fisher is saying right now: "In relativity, we're going to use the principle of maximal aging. And this goes back to what we were talking about, about different kinds of time. So we're sitting here in 6-120, which we'll call a lab frame, or Frame S. And we can measure the time it takes for an object to go from spacetime coordinates A to B. That's the time that we would measure using this clock, watching something roll across the floor. Like if a mouse came out. There used to be a rat that lived here and came waddling out a couple of times a few years ago. I think he's dead now. Now if the rat were relativistic, and had a wristwatch on its neck, it would measure a different time. It would measure its wristwatch time. So remember, this is an absolutely cornerstone idea of relativity: there is something called wristwatch time, proper time, observer time, that is attached to whatever object you're watching move around. And that clock is always at rest with respect to that object. And so our statement of the principle of least time is that this trajectory occurs...such that the wristwatch time from A to B is minimized." 3:01pm "Metrics in general relativity are called g. I have a friend whose license plate is GMuNu*...that metric refers to flat spacetime." *g^() 5:26pm - The floor of the French House maisonette My sister and her friend and Asra '17 are studying for an 18.701 (Algebra I*) test, with the help of Adam '15. I just got home, after an 45 min-ish Skype chat with an astronomy professor at BU. I had some questions about the astro grad school application process, and he was very helpful. I also passed along my boyfriend's message that he gave an excellent talk at the recent DPS conference. *Not the kind of Algebra I you're thinking of. 6:49pm - My room This evening, I made a Trader Joe's trip and bought the following: a baguette, brie, a bottle of sparkling pink lemonade, and two boxes of strawberries. "For a midnight birthday celebration?!" you ask. No. I made the Trader Joe's run because I'm going to spend the next 4-5 hours trying to finish all of my fellowship applications, and I want to make a party out of it. 8:37pm - The French House Maisonette I went to put my laundry in the dryer, checked my mail, and found a very sweet birthday card from my grandma. I LOVE YOU GRANDMA! :D 11:25pm - The French House Maisonette Cheers, screams, bangs, smoke. The Red Sox just won the World Series, and we have a spectacular view of Fenway Park out the window across the river. Midnight - The French House Maisonette I have some very punctual friends. :)  With our November 1 Early Action deadline looming (Friday!), we're here to answer your questions.  How can we help?  Answers below in the comments.  I will try to update this post with FAQs. Adding some answers to FAQs...

I had the same feeling two weeks ago, while hanging out with my boyfriend's aunt in Montana (long story; just roll with it). She lives in Hot Springs, which had a population of 544 in the 2010 census. This is about the size of New House + McCormick. I grew up in Singapore and London, which have populations of 5.3 and 8.2 million people respectively, so Hot Springs seemed very exotic.  While my boyfriend stayed behind and chopped wood (also exotic to a city girl) his aunt took me to a fashion show, organized by one of her friends. This friend owns a second-hand clothing store, and decided to have some fun with it: she got together a bunch of the residents, dressed them up, transformed her living room into a stage + bar + music, and invited around 40 Hot Spring residents. We sat in three rows of chairs lining the walls; everyone knew everyone else, and smiled and took pictures and cheered for their friends. My boyfriend's aunt leaned over to fill me in on who each model was: "that's the town masseuse!", for example. I sat and cheered with everyone else, trying to process what I was seeing. 40 people in a town of 544 in Montana, running a fashion show and having a total blast. I tried to estimate how many towns like it there were in Montana, how many little communities. Next to Montana are Washington, North Dakota, South Dakota, Wyoming, Idaho...and then think of all the other states, all the other towns. All the countries. My head hurt, like it does when I look at town lights out of the airplane at night and try to imagine how many lives are playing out on the ground. There are so many people on Earth.  By the way, Montana is stunning:    - The vertigo returned today. I'm at the Conference of Research Experiences for Undergraduates Student Scholarship, run by the Council on Undergraduate Research. 2/3 of the 240 individuals registered for the event (a little under half the population of Hot Springs!) are students: they represent all of the disciplines funded by the National Science Foundation. The first day (yesterday), the president of the CUR (pronounced curr, like the first syllable in curry) talked about the growth of the organization, the importance of the conference in giving us perspective on research being conducted outside our narrow discipline, and putting our work in context. Then, NSF's REU program coordinator gave us an overview of the NSF: the history (it emerged out of the Cold War fear that the US was lagging behind other countries in R&D), funding issues (pretty depressing stuff), and the review process that determines which research proposals to fund. After that, we were dismissed to snack on hors d'oeuvres, contemplate the lack of financial support for our discipline, and visit faculty posters.  Today, the day was split between poster and breakout sessions. I attended a session on "Planning a Successful Career," where a career advice specialist talked about deciding between grad school and a full-time job, and gave us suggestions for resources. After lunch, I went to a session on "Advocacy and Federal Funding: What Every Student Should Know," where reps from a consulting company in DC urged us to reach out to our district office, and tell the staff members how important and transforming undergraduate research has been for us.  Between and after the breakout sessions, there were open poster sessions. When I wasn't explaining my poster to everyone from mechanical engineering professors to computer scientist, physicist, and biologist undergrads, I was wandering around trying to process the vast, VAST array of poster titles. "Frictional Properties of Graphene on a Functionalized Rough Surface." "Promoting Spatial Thinking in Natural Resource Management Through Community Mapping: The Case of Urban and Rural Secondary Schools in Rwanda." "Semi-Active Suspension Testing Platform." "Performance Characterization of a Wind-Powered Water Pump." "Control Improvisation with Application to Jazz Music." I learned that midges transport nitrogen from ocean water to sandy banks. I learned that you can stunt a poplar tree's growth by depriving it of copper. I learned that there's a group in Arkansas, developing a glove for people going through physiological therapy, that will enable them to play fun games while improving their motor skills.  A mechanical engineering professor GRILLED me about stars, pulsars, finding pulsars, magnetic fields of pulsars, the discovery of pulsars, and the applicability of pulsar research. We were both so excited that our voices got louder and louder and pretty soon the whole section of the poster hall was an audience. When he left, and I nearly collapsed with fatigue, the people around me said "wow, that was intense." It was such a pleasure to tell an engineer about my work. I love astronomers, and I love talking with astronomers, but it's refreshing to bounce ideas off people with different backgrounds. It was also a pleasure to say "I disagree with that" very firmly, and defend why my work was important. So there! I went through waves of vertigo. I went to the same REU program for the past two summers, and before this conference had zero perspective on just how vast the program really is. There are SO. MANY. STUDENTS. From SO. MANY. INSTITUTIONS. Doing SO. MANY. PROJECTS. And doing those projects deeply, in extremely specialized areas of science, math, and engineering . Last summer, there was a kid whose life revolved around depriving poplar trees of copper, while mine revolved around probing the galactic magnetic field strength using pulsars, and my new friend Eli developed a glove for physical and occupational therapy patients. One girl explained to me that she's not going to graduate school because she doesn't want to continue being more specialized, while others talked about medical school and theoretical physics graduate school.  - As a researcher, you can get obsessed with and trapped in your little specialty bubble. You can spend YOUR ENTIRE LIFE studying one celestial object! I've been in a bubble, simply by spending two summers at one institution, in one field - imagine what it's like in graduate school and deeper in academia. At the end of the program, one of the organizers asked us to raise our hand if during this conference we got ideas for our research project from a seemingly unrelated field - and at least half of the students raised their hands. That's actually a LOT, when you consider that there was only one student representing each REU program. I feel a little shaken, now that I'm aware of just how ignorant I was (and probably continue to be) about the breadth of research specialties out there. But there's a battle to fight both in advocating for the importance of undergraduate research, and frankly STEM research in general - and we're so much more effective when we can advocate for each other as well as for ourselves. So, I would encourage any reseacher to make an effort to attend colloquia outside your field, and take full advantage of your wider environment. Don't be embarrassed to ask the "I really don't know anything about this subject; please educate me" questions, because people are REALLY happy to share knowledge. Your brain may hurt now, but it - and the next generations of scientists - will thank you later.  Its nearly the end of October, and autumn has finally begun coloring the city of Boston. Bakers annual piano drop (this time, filled with candy) happened yesterday afternoon, people flocked to Save TFPs Spooky Skate yesterday night, and the annual pumpkin drop from the Green Building (wonderfully blogged last year by Michael) is tonight. Tis the season for costumes, merriment, and, apparently, smashing things. You have to relieve stress from midterms somehow, right?  (Im a little bit sad that no random leaves ended up in this picture. Its really cool to see the wind whisk them off the ground and up 12 floors where they flutter around like little scraggly butterflies.) Two weekends ago was Columbus Day (though The Oatmeal argues that we should call it Bartolome Day instead, because he was a much nicer guy), and we were given a four-day weekend to catch up on work/sleep/fun/etc. Personally, I seized the opportunity to travel to New York, wander around the city, meet up with friends from high school who also ended up on the East Coast for university, see Big Fish and Matilda, and go to New York Comic Con. One of the greatest parts about college is the independence you acquire once you move away from home. And one huge part of this independence is being able to say, Hey, MIT, youre alright. But sometimes I really just have to step away from campus, and leaving. Because you can. Its refreshing to see old friends and catch up, to dress in cosplay and geek out with other fans, to go to a city where there are non-academic-seeking tourists and artists and people simply living their lives, and to remember theres a world outside of psets and tests and the MIT bubble. Initially, my plan was to take video clips and create a Vlogbrothers-esque Thoughts from Places video about New York, but that kind of failed. I didnt bring a nice camera, so all the videos were taken on a phone camera... and are cropped in a thin rectangle... Nice going, Ceri. You really thought that one through. Instead of recording and overlaying commentary, I just quickly edited clips together, added some music, altered some of the sound levels and color balances, and uploaded the grainy derp-project for anyone who still would like to see. Failed blog post idea #398. Maybe someday Ill make a legitimate video like this on MIT campus... one that's shorter and better edited and more purposeful. This is a blog entry specifically for finalists in the QuestBridge National College Match. If you dont know what this is, dont worry! You can read the updates for Early Action at this blog entry: http://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/early-action-updates-2013 If you are a finalist  congratulations! Were excited to have you applying to MIT through QuestBridge. Here are some FAQs that QuestBridge applicants often have at this stage: Q: I am taking my tests in November/December/January. Am I still eligible for the Match?A: If you have not completed all the testing requirements by the October test dates, you will not qualify for the Match. If you have not completed your testing by October, do not worry; you do not have to remove MIT from your rank list because if you do not match with any school on December 2nd, we will simply email you instructions with how to roll over into our Early Action process. We will accept up to November test scores for Early Action, and up to January test scores for Regular Action. Q: If I will not have a full set of tests by the October testing date, what happens? Should I unrank MIT or withdraw my application?A: If your application is incomplete, we will not be able to match you. However, we would be able to consider you during Early Action (just a few weeks later) if your application is complete by then and you did not match. We can consider you for Regular Action as well, as long as your application is complete and you did not match to a binding school. If you take MIT off your rank list or withdraw your application, your application may not be able to be considered for Early Action. Q: Should I rush report my scores to get them to you in time?A: I previously answered this incorrectly in the comments and apologize. Best case scenario is of course, that you selected that your scores be directly sent to MIT. If you did not, and are worried if they will get here in time, we will accept an unofficial score report faxed or mailed in the meantime. Please mention that you are a QB applicant, along with full name and date of birth on the cover sheet. Q: Where do I send my high school transcript or updates?A: You can fax it to us at 617-687-9184 or mail it to MIT Office of Admissions, 77 Massachusetts Avenue, Room 10-100, Cambridge, MA 02139. Make sure your full name and date of birth are included, as well as the word "QuestBridge". Q: Where do I send my financial documents?A: Fax them to the MIT Financial Aid Office at 617-253-9859, or mail them to: MIT Student Financial Services, Attn: QuestBridge Coordinator, 77 Massachusetts Avenue, Room 11-320, Cambridge, MA 02139-4307. If you have questions about your financial documents, email sfs@mit.edu. Q: How do I schedule an interview?A: You can find your interviewer's information by logging in to your MyMIT account (http://my.mit.edu). Please be patient when trying to get in touch with them, as it may take them several days to respond to your request. If you have problems accessing your interviewer's information, contact [email protected]/* <![CDATA[ */(function(){try{var s,a,i,j,r,c,l,b=document.getElementsByTagName("script");l=b[b.length-1].previousSibling;a=l.getAttribute('data-cfemail');if(a){s='';r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16);for(j=2;a.length-j;j+=2){c=parseInt(a.substr(j,2),16)^r;s+=String.fromCharCode(c);}s=document.createTextNode(s);l.parentNode.replaceChild(s,l);}}catch(e){}})();/* ]]> */ for assistance. If you have not yet contacted your interviewer, do note that the deadline for interviews has passed. However, you may still be able to do an interview. While we cannot guarantee that interviewers will be able to accommodate you, some will accept late interviews on a case-by-case basis. Completing an interview can be helpful for your application, especially if you intend to remain in the Regular Action pool. Q: Why hasnt my Questbridge application shown up on my MyMIT tracking page?A: Colleges only just received your application. It will take approximately one week to process your application; your MyMIT tracking page should be updated by early next week. (You may see your tracking page show Part 1 and Part 2 as complete because your QuestBridge application is being used in place of the MIT application). Q: I've already done an interview, but the interview is not checked off on the MyMIT tracking system. What should I do?A: Just notify us through the MyMIT website that you have conducted the interview so that we know to expect a report from your interviewer. Q: If I'm not matched, can I still apply to MIT for Early and/or Regular Action?A: On December 2nd, QuestBridge will announce the results of the National College Match. If you are not matched with any school, we will send you an email asking whether you would like to be considered for MIT's Early Action and/or Regular Action processes (or neither). Please look out for this message and respond to it quickly, so we know what to do with your application. See the Questbridge FAQ for more info. This weekend, in some order, I: 1. slept for twelve hours straight in one night2. watched experienced the Rocky Horror Picture Show, live3. learned about cornhole4. went to Nightmarket It was a very good weekend. Because that's how it is in my head, let's go through these in a totally arbitrary order, starting with number 2. My first exposure to Rocky Horror was, to the chagrin of many, actually a fairly watered-down version adapted by Glee in season 2, episode 5. I won't say much about Rocky Horror other than that it is very much an experience more than it is a show. Involved: corsets, crossdressing, lipstick, aliens, sexual objectification, and tons of music and dancing. I highly recommend it as a Halloween activity, if not necessarily for the content, then at least for the musical value and street cred. Here's one of the first songs: One more thing about Rocky Horror: for some reason, the showing started at midnight. More on this. For now, let's do a time warp and go back a couple hours. It was about 2:00, Friday afternoon. I had just gotten out of my last lecture of this short but nevertheless long-feeling three-day week, differential equations, and I was hanging out with one of the campus FOCUS missionaries (they're awesome). He spotted some of the other missionaries on Kresge lawn playing ball, and a few minutes later we had formed teams for a game of cornhole. "What," you might ask, "in the world is cornhole?" As an Asian-American growing up in California, I had personally never heard of cornhole. Essentially, there are two wooden blocks, shaped like wedges of cheese, with a small hole cut into each near the top center. Simply put, the goal is to land beanbags onto the wedges (one point), or into the holes (three points) if you're feeling particularly talented. Harder than it seems--beanbags are not aerodynamic. But after playing for thirty minutes or so, I got the hang of it (sort of) and even landed a few beanbags into the hole. It was a surprisingly idyllic way to spend a Friday afternoon, tossing beanbags and footballs around with a nice breeze blowing through the trees. I do hope this nice weather stays as long as possible (guess I'm a California boy at heart). Back on topic. That night, at 8:00, I went to Nightmarket. Nightmarket, hosted by the three biggest Asian cultural clubs on campus, mirrors the East Asian phenomenon of the nighttime street market, associated with pretty lights and tons of delicous food. MIT Nightmarket threw in a glorious slew of performances, ranging from Chinese yo-yo tricks to Western yo-yo tricks, Taiko drumming, Korean, drumming, traditional and contemporary performances by the esteemed MIT Asian Dance Team, an extremely colorful bhangra performance, and many more that I'm sure I'm forgetting. People came all the way from Harvard and Wellesley to attend and perform. It was wonderfully immersive and super-Asian; to tell the truth, I didn't expect to enjoy it quite as much as I did (my high school was and still is around 85% Asian), but Nightmarket was so well put-together and just generally a great time. Pictures follow: Bhangra! A very colorful, very energetic Punjabi genre of folk dance. The one, the only, the amazing MIT Asian Dance Team. In which this guy uses a yo-yo to...demonstrate his mastery of physics? Look badass? All of the above? Speaking of badass: taiko percussion, which originates in Japan but was kindly brought to Nightmarket by Wellesley Aiko. After Nightmarket, I headed over, with some old friends and some freshly-made friends, to Rocky Horror, which for some reason started at 11:59 PM and ended a few hours later. I crawled to Next House exhausted, stopped in the lounge to talk about Thevenin equivalency (three cheers for 8.022 Electricity and Magnetism, affectionately nicknamed "eight-oh-QQ"), and found myself in bed shortly thereafter. When I woke up again it was 5:00 PM on Saturday. I regret nothing. See you soon, Allan    Two months ago, after spending ten disastrous minutes walking in the wrong direction, I saw Random Hall for the first time. As I walked into my dorm, struggling with my luggage, I barely noticed the five-story structure just across the street, with balconies jutting outwards, bearing in white letters on a green backdrop, three Greek letters.   *** A few weeks have passed since freshman orientation, turning it into this blur of free food, information sessions and friendship cultivation that lies buried under a mound of problem sets and midterms. However, each time I'm thought-lost enough to tread memory lane, at least two events stand out in my mind. First: I remember being a speck among many one afternoon, staring across a crowded room at a woman who held a little remote control that was constantly directed at the large projected screen behind her. Every few seconds, the words on the screen would morph. Small shuffling sounds would ripple through the room as people rose. She would say something. People would sit. The words would morph again and the pattern would continue. The words were shifting statements, directed at us. If you identify as multi-racial...If you identify as a child of a single-parent...If you are first-generation...If both your parents went to MIT...If you intend to major in the humanities... The statements spanned all spectrums of human life, from income to political identities, from cultural backgrounds to academic interests. People rose because they had seen statements they identified with. And across this wall of diversity, there was always a statement that reflected as true with a significant number of people. The sense that MIT was a microcosm of the world was enormous, and even in this diverse multitude, we saw gripping similarities. An overwhelming number of students rose to, If you have fears about your ability to handle the workload... And just because of that, we all knew we would be fine. Second: a recent alum spoke about her experience when she had been coming into MIT, and the jarring effect the new and largely different atmosphere had struck on her. She concluded with: And the most important thing I learnt to do was to adjust, rather than compromise. Those words took hold of my mind. I wrote them down on a board in my room. They stuck. Shifting MindsetsOrientation was followed by Rush, a week-long event in which fraternities, sororities and Independent Living Groups tried to get the MIT community, primarily freshmen, to know them. Always on the lookout for free food, I hurried eagerly to the premiere event of Rushthe Kresge Kickoffand quickly found myself dealing with an armful of brochures, cards and cookies. Seen any frat you like yet? one of my friends asked. Nope, I replied. Don't really plan to join any. Prior to Rush, my entire idea of fraternities had been merrily supplied by a few American movies I'd watched, pictures of wild, endless parties and great academic indifference. I didn't really think anyone in MIT would approach their academic work with indifference, but my overall mindset of a fraternity had solidified itself several years ago, and there was no arguing with it. If I wanted to have a college experience not defined in bulk by beer pongs and drunk friends, I'd have to make sure I didn't join a frat. You can probably see this plot's resolution even from a satellite orbiting Neptune. Six days later, I pledged to Alpha Delta Phi. What happened?  Well, it should be straightforward, right? And it mostly is. While navigating the crowd at the Kresge Kickoff, I met two interesting people wearing green shirts with yellow symbols on the front and a phrase on the back: to be the best of men. One of them, Ryan Shepard, seemed to run on fusion energy and his cheerfulness was infectious. He told me about an ongoing lunch at ADPhi and, one Google Map search later, I was on the way there. Right now, the thought that a phase in my life devoid of ADPhi had existed seems strange. It's integrated so well into my ongoing college experience that heading to ADPhi for dinner takes the same fluid, unstructured effort as going to bed at night. There are a few reasons why. ***I remember staying up late at the ADPhi Library on the ground floor, drawing chromosome structures and trying to wrap my head around recombination frequency to complete a biology p-set. Several ideas seemed to conflict, suggesting my obvious lack of familiarity with the material. One of the ADPhi Brothers walked into the library, stood over my shoulder and watched me make biological blunders of probably illegal intensity.  Geez, I mumbled to myself. Is this even going to work? That's kinda right, he chimed in. Next thing I knew, he was re-explaining the tricky parts of chromosome cross-overs and allele configuration with enough patience and clarity for me to finally realize what I'd been doing wrong. My battle with the p-set turned from a bloody warfare to a mildly stinging debacle.    There's an air of comfort in the frat that partly stems from knowing that the brothers there truly look out for you. They don't drag you out of p-sets and into wild parties every day of the week. They sit in their rooms and ask if you want to work on a p-set or play a quick game or go grocery shopping. They ask how your day went and how far you've gone on that one paper you've been saying you'll start on for weeks. They merrily announce your goofiest goof-ups to any nearby brother while sticking their tongues out at you. There's a sense of pride and responsibility that comes from sharing things with people, from looking out for and doing things with them. We take weekly or bi-weekly turns doing some form of house jobcleaning up after dinner or tidying up the lounges or securing the library books. The added responsibility is not really something we get from dormitories, and while it is in no way essential, you get meaning from just casually thinking about the purpose of those actions. For your brothers. And because no one likes to eat from a grimy plate. We know at least one thing that makes a story great: impeccable plotting that follows from well-constructed characters. Character diversity provides friction, an energy that defines how the characters behave in different situations. A great story that builds on the development of characters leaves you with this feeling of satisfaction, that things are beautifully running together, that characters that seem rather mismatched are able to connect well, that fragments of personalities blend to make a seamless patchwork quilt. This very strong sense of unity is something I see everyday at ADPhi. The Brothers here have reached a point of familiarity that makes their quirks and habits seem intuitive, and being able to blend into that kind of bond makes me happy. In high school, I worked on a handwritten science-fiction series called Sagittarius, and one of the elements of the series questioned the validity of something the characters called: Sequences of the Cosmos. It's a fairly philosophical question that basically says: Given an abstract sequence which takes in as input, the singular world as it has existed from 'the beginning' till this very instance, including the people that are part of it and their behaviors, will it produce a single output of the future? The statement essentially reduces to an argument for or against freewill, and I was still trying to work out the kinks of this sequence when I saw an e-mail from a brother to the ADPhi House about a philosophical discussion on the nature of freewill and a deterministic universe. It was just one of those things people wanted to do for the fun of it, and I gratefully showed up, listened to the different arguments and mentally reconstructed my own sequence. A few nights ago, we sat outside on a patio in the chilly half-darkness and told scary stories. Stories about cackling old men and children-seeking ghosts, about rat-infested towns and congregations of spiders. It was during one of these stories that I realized that the fraternity had definitely become an absolute and effortless part of my life. A few times, for a few reasons, I had wondered why I had pledged, and if that commitment had been worth it, but the self-assurance that I had made the right decision was never far away. I joined ADPhi, because at the end of Rush Week, I had this feeling that I would fit in perfectly. You might want to chime up at this point with the old adage of our ability to fit in anywhere, but I definitely know that there are a few communities in MIT I wouldn't easily fit into. I also know that it was enough to just have spent Rush Week in ADPhi, playing Rock Band with brothers for long, late stretches of hours, battling with angry lobsters during dinner and having their innards splash all over my shirt, doing these different fun things with these different fun people. It had been enough to spend all that time there, and get that nearly clairvoyant sense that I would always want to be around these people, not just when I was having fun, but when I began grazing low rocks and hitting hard times.  Rush had finally come to end. My roommate and I had received bids from ADPhi. I was trying to make sense of my thoughts when my roommate asked, Are you going to pledge? I thought of Rock Band and lobster and a few dozen smiling faces wearing shirts that said, To be the Best of Men. I thought of conversations and my growing ease and of what it would mean to not see these people again. Finally, I felt a glimmer of that obstinate mindset that frats would add no value to my college experience, and I understood that it was completely false. I had had immense fun with a lot of the events the ADPhi Brothers had put up, but what struck me about my ease came from the brothers themselvesthe ones that would never stop talking about past antics, that were three seconds away from making an outrageously funny joke or a super-weird statement, that had spent a crazily long time talking to me about my interests and their hometowns. I didn't have to compromise my values to adjust my initial obstinate mindset. Adjust, don't compromise. Yeah, I replied, smiling a little, because I was lucky to have brothers I cared about, and brothers that cared about me. I'm going to.                You: Where are you from?Me: London.You: But you...you don't...you don't seem to have a British accent.Me: Correct. Let me explain! I was born in Singapore, had a Singaporean accent, then moved to London during the summer before fifth... read more  see complete archives  I am a first-semester senior. As a result, my brain has been swimming in fellowship deadlines and requirements, graduate school applications, and the possibility of a full-time job; occasionally, it comes up for air and remembers that I'm actually enrolled as a full-time student at MIT and need to do psets. This is what I have to look forward to:  I realize that most of this readership has never applied to either grad school or fellowships, so let me bring you up to speed: Astronomy Graduate School Research Fellowships In conclusion: I have a lot to do over the next few months. I would not be surviving without an open stream of communication with friends who have gone through this before: French House alums and summer intern companions have been wonderfully supportive. This has been a particularly weird, disorienting semester; I spend so much time thinking about what's coming up next year that it's hard to keep my mind in school and on my psets. The routine of pset, pset, paper, pset, pset, exam, isn't as prominent as usual. And that's made forming new habits even more important.  Habits, routines: doing the same thing, every day or every few days or every week at the same time. I've never been particularly good at forming habits (New Year's resolution: "I will run FIVE MILES, EVERY DAY, for the REST OF MY LIFE!" or "NO MORE COOKIES, EVER!") but this semester I've developed a few that have kept me sane. They are: I think that habits - particularly post-wakeup and pre-bed ones - are particularly stabilizing because they provide a framework for everything to fall into. Even if you have a really chaotic, stressful day, you know that a chapter of Blue Mars awaits, and that you get to spend half an hour watching the Martians write a constitution. And in the morning, you don't need to feel stressed immediately, because you can chill out and read the news for a while. And you can never really feel guilty about going for a run, because you can think of it as a long-term investment.  Finally, I'm sorry for the recent blogging silence -- ironically, I lost the habit. But the best way to regain a habit is to just start doing it again.  I noticed something great about the MIT Admissions blogs as the days have gone on. Everyones so passionate about their posts, and all of us do a great job of describing life at MIT. Theyre all creatively written and well-thought out, and they tie together all the different aspects of MIT. Then I noticed something that I had missed in my post. Pictures!  I need more pictures.  But of what?  I know, I'll show pictures of some of a few of my "firsts" here at MIT (There's many more, but this is just a few.) But instead of just throwing them at you, Im going to show you zoomed-in pictures and let you guess.   Picture #1  Wrong Answer: Stuff that I paid for. Right Answer: Stuff that I got for free at the Career Fair!  Yes! My first Career Fair!. All of my favorite companies in one gymnasium.  It was like having every celebrity you love from every movie youve ever seen all congregated in one location. Google, Apple, Yahoo, Dropbox, Mozilla, Google, Microsoft, Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Google, Adobe, Bose, Cisco, eBay, Amazon, Google, Facebook, Codecademy, Evernote, Google, Gameloft, Groupon, Hulu, IBM, Intel, Google, JPMorgan, NASA, NVIDIA, Pandora, Samsung, SanDisk, Snapchat, Sony, Texas Instruments, Google, Tumblr, Twitter, Yelp, and Google! (I spent a lot of time at the Google table.)  All of these big-name companies that are revolutionizing the world had come for the sole purpose of recruiting me! Well, not quite. They didnt want me. They wanted the upper classmen. I was just the guy who was keeping them from talking to the guy they wanted to hire. But who cares! I met all of them, got a sense of what theyre like, and I got so much free stuff that I wont need to buy shirts for another year. If you want to read more about what the Career Fair was like, check out Allans blog post:http://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/fanboying-at-the-career-fair     Picture #2  Wrong Answer: HackMIT Right Answer: Outside of HackMIT because I wasnt allowed inside.  I was so excited for HackMIT. I found out about it back in August and wanted to sign up ever since. Unfortunately, I wasnt able to participate in it this year because of other events, but nonetheless I found the time to make the trek over to Kresge to get a peek inside. However, it seemed as though many other MIT kids had the same idea to sneak inside and take a peek. They tightened up security outside of HackMIT and now they wouldnt let any MIT students in that werent participating in HackMIT. Bummer. I asked and the guy said the best he could let me do was take a picture standing at the entrance of the tent. Now that I think of it, if I made it clearer that I was an MIT blogger hungry for pictures, they mightve let me in. I think Im going to print myself a laminated badge that says Official MIT Blogger and wear it around my neck along with a reporters hat. Oh well, on to the next hackathon.     Picture #3  Wrong Answer: The Alchemist not dressed as a character from a legendary AMC show Right Answer: The Alchemist dressed as Walter White, the main character from the legendary AMC show Breaking Bad.  Finally, seeing my first big MIT hack just there in plain sight! That means someone was here in the middle of the night. Someone mustve thought Hey, wouldnt it be cool to turn The Alchemist into Walter White? Someone mustve taken the time to make the flasks, the beard, the sunglasses, and the hat. And theres also bags of fake meth behind both flasks. I saw this hack and I thought Yep, this is what MIT is all about. Taking things that no one else would ever think of and pulling them into reality." Even seemingly trivial things like dressing up a statue in honor of the ending of a TV show. It's the little things that count. These are just some examples of the cool things I've seen at MIT so far.  It's crazy to think that all these cool things are now part of my everyday life.  They say that too much of a good thing isn't so good but at MIT there's just so much variety that the good things keep on coming.  - Erick P. see complete archives  Its mid-October in Cambridge, which means the days are growing shorter, the leaves are changing color, and several thousand people are in the process of applying to MIT. The latter of these changes is always accompanied by questions, so I wanted to take a moment to answer some of the more frequent ones weve seen arriving in our inboxes recently. First, you should review our detailed guide to submitting letters of recommendations, as it answers most of the questions that students have. The upshot is that we require three letters: one from a math/science teacher, one from a humanities/social studies teacher, and one from a guidance counselor. Find the teachers who will be able to advocate most compellingly on your behalf and have them send letters to us. It's pretty simple. We accept letters through the following submission methods: Your recommenders may use any one of these systems. Emphasis on one: please do not have them send us duplicates of the same letter through different systems, unless you want me to look like this: () while I open all of the extra mail and faxes. And if your teachers do use fax or mail, remember their letters must be on school letterhead and signed by them to be accepted. One question we sometimes get is about cover sheets for letters of recommendation. You can download the MIT Admissions cover sheets from your account in MyMIT. These cover sheets are strongly recommended but not required. If your teachers want to use the Common App cover sheets, that's fine. If they submit through Naviance/Docufide and don't have cover sheets, that's fine. Our MIT cover sheets are nice to have because they expedite the processing of your documents, but not worth causing any additional stress for you or your advocates. If you submit your Part 1, you will have access to MyMIT's application component tracking system, which keeps track of everything we have from you in the admissions process. If you've submitted something, and it isnt showing up, dont worry: it takes time to process tens of thousands of documents! You should allow at least two weeks after submission before contacting our office to inquire after the status of submitted supplemental materials. As the essay prompts suggest, there is a word count limit (well technically, a character count limit with an estimated average character per word, but well just go with word count). You may find that MyMIT and your text editor disagree sometimes on how many words there are in a given text, and if this happens, well, trust MyMIT. You can always check how your essays look in the PDF preview, which is more or less exactly how the PDFs are generated for us. A note on text editors: if you use Microsoft Word (or any other rich text editor) to draft your essays you may find that that your PDF preview becomes HAUNTED by spooky formatting ghosts. I recommend drafting your posts in a free plain text editor, like Notepad in Windows, TextWrangler on Mac, or nano/emacs/vi/whatever in *nix. As a rule of thumb: if it saves by default in .txt, it's safe to use.  Every year a very, very small number of students decide to reapply to MIT for freshman admission. As a matter of policy we consider these applications anew. In order to do that, we need to archive and delete the old applications from our database first. Because of some improvements we made to our application database, that archiving process is going a bit slower than expected this year (ironic, I know). As a result, we've not yet deleted the old applications from our database, and so people who applied last year can't reapply again yet. If youre a reapplicant applying to MIT for Early Action, dont worry. Well extend your Early Action application date until November 7th. In the meantime, you can draft your essays using the prompts I posted a few weeks ago, which are taken directly from our application this year. Well announce once we have safely archived our database. At that point, you will be able to recreate a MyMIT account and begin filling out your application. You should also contact your EC, let them know that you are a reapplicant (and thus have had delayed access to MyMIT), and they should be able to accommodate your request for an interview. Fixed! Go ahead! Good? Good. Remember to review the dates and deadlines, let me know if you have any questions in the comments below, and, in the meantime, enjoy a Halloween Pusheen.   As an alum, people often ask me what I liked the most about being at MIT.  The honest answer?  THE PEOPLE!  So I'm going to tell you stories about some of the awesome and amazing people that I went to school with, so you can see what kinds of really fantastic and interesting and great people you will be surrounded by and also see what these people are doing now after graduating from MIT. So today let me introduce you to Brian.   Brian came to MIT from California as an undergrad.  He majored in Mechanical Engineering but decided to do some research in the Math department.  This "little" undergraduate research project netted him a cover article for one of the most prestigious research journals in the world: Nature.  He helped to figure out a longstanding mystery in fluid mechanics about how water-striding insects propel themselves on the water surface.      And then he built a mechanical water strider to test out the theory.      It turned out that Brian was pretty good at research (that's a huge understatement, but he's a modest person so I don't want to embarass him by saying how FREAKING AWESOME he is at research), so he stayed at MIT.  After finishing his PhD in mechanical engineering, he went on to work in the MIT Hobby Shop, so that he can teach generations of MIT students how to create anything they imagine.  The Hobby Shop (one of the first MakerSpaces on campus) just reopened after a 75th anniversary renovation.   Brian and I went to the Gala Celebration of the Hobby Shop's 75th anniversary last Friday.    Oh, and in case you thought Brian wasn't cool enough, he's also an origami expert.  This is him with the MIT seal origami that he designed and folded.      Want to watch him fold it?  Yes, he is that awesome!   See more of Brian's awesomeness and many of his creations at his website. One week ago, an eclectic group of ambitious young men and women flocked to HackMIT to crowd themselves into a gym for 30 hours and make...something. The hacking arena. The ingredients: ideas, sleeplessness, Red Bull, and a steady flow of snacks that ranged from burritos to late-night "insomnia cookies" to breakfast bagels with half-and-half milk. Toss in a hallway lined with air mattresses for catnappers, and throw in a bunch of toys: Oculus Rifts, Pebble watches, Google Glasses, Arduinos, breadboards...all sandboxes for building castles. Put them all together, slap on a deadline, and you've got yourself a hackathon. Insomnia Cookies: honestly some of the best cookies I've ever had. Rocking the Oculus Rift. Hacking, as defined by Wikipedia: "the act of engaging in activities (such as programming or other media) in a spirit of playfulness and exploration." Don't confuse it with chopping down trees, or serious coughing, or the illegal entry of computer systems. Hacking is no less than the building of the future. For one team, that future was one with a smart refrigerator mounted with an internal webcam that would detect, identify, and tag with an expiration date any food placed inside it. Another team was hard at work making a Grand Theft Auto-inspired game set in, well, any setting on Earth the player wanted, as long as it was on Google Maps. Yet another team was going to reinvent the breathalyzer. "Are you going to need testers for that?" joked another hacker on break from coding his Chrome extension that would allow users to copy-paste text directly from in-browser image files. That hacker, Kevin K. '17, ended up winning second place (and $2000) in the hackathon, beat out only by a hack that lets users draw on a 3-D digital whiteboard by moving a flashlight in front of a webcam. The second-place-winning project of HackMIT 2013, in the making. I...am not a hacker (yet). I went into the hackathon with a mild curiosity for this new phenomenon, armed with Rastaban (my camera) because the HackMIT organizers gave lucky me the opportunity to help photograph the event. I wandered out of the hackathon slightly dazed, very tired, and incredibly motivated to build the skills to become a hacker by next year's HackMIT. New goal for myself: finish the current Codecademy curriculum (and become fluent enough in those languages to build my own castles) by the end of summer 2014.  More sights from the hackathon below. Enjoy!Yours,Allan  Plexiglass windows function fairly well as whiteboards. Or should I say, clearboards? Even hackers need backrubs sometimes. Cookie distribution. Hacking under the HackMIT logo. HackMIT in a nutshell. Have you ever heard the joke: Whats green and has wheels? A logical person might stroke his beard and say, Hm. Well lets see, that could be one of many things. Im thinking maybe an alligator with rollerblades? Or maybe a green van? Thats green and has wheels, right? A practical person, however, would recognize the tell-tale signs of a bad joke and wait for the inevitable punch line. In which case Id happily comply and say, Grass. I lied about the wheels. Ha! Its the epitome of the anti-joke: unexpected and irrational enough to elicit the obligatory chuckle of awkwardness, but still, to everyones chagrin, logically sound in a roundabout kind of way. The Festival of Bad Ad Hoc Hypotheses (or BAH!Fest for short) that was held Sunday night in Kresge auditorium was essentially one enormous anti-joke. The premise? Have seven educated individuals present seven well-argued, but astronomically absurd evolutionary theories in front of a panel of distinguished judges. To the victor go the spoils. And by spoils, they mean a 3-D printed rendering of Charles Darwin looking doubtful and saying, I guess so? I had seen fliers for the event plastered all over campus, the colorful paper and clever acronym drawing me in. As an added bonus, I found out that the event would be put on by the writer of the Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal web comic, Zach Weinersmith. How could I resist the intersection of my two loves, biology and comically improbable possibilities? Can I just take a moment here to marvel at the beauty of the message boards on campus? Honestly. Theres just something magical about the intense disarray of clashing colors and screaming words that fascinates me. Every day, there are new events, new club meetings, and new advertisements to peruse. Most people just stream by, either chatting with friends or staring at their feet, absorbed in their own thoughts. But the message boards are home to a wealth of information, so take advantage of them. If you ever see a girl standing in front of a message board for an irrationally long time, its probably me.  Bask in the entropy of informational dissemination Anyway. Thankfully, my roommate and I had pre-ordered tickets online; the event sold out. We entered Kresge without any expectations and boy, were those expectations exceeded. Zach Weinersmith and the host Ben Lillie were wizards. Real life wizards, minus the flowing beards and silly robes. But probably a lot funnier than most wizards. So actually, scratch that, they werent wizards at all. Just really funny guys. They warded off the 25 minute technical difficulty with ease, introducing the premise of the event once again and warming up the audience with a semi-enthusiastic MIT greater than Caltech! courtesy of an online bet and a sold out show. The crowd laughed and clapped like it was adaptively beneficial to be the loudest ones there. Heres a picture of Zach Weinersmith presenting the very hypothesis that started it all. (Sorry for the forest of heads and poor quality. I was trying to be sneaky with my photography)  Yes. You read that correctly: Infantapulting  (verb) the act of catapulting an infant from village to village in order to increase the diversity of its gene pool. I wont go into the details of his hypothesis, but I will say that they involved baby aerodynamics, laminar flow, and our attraction to people with smooth skin. Every presenter wielded graphs, citations, and visual aids with aplomb in their attempts to woo the judges. My personal favorite was a hypothesis that claimed, rather successfully if you ask me, that animals evolved to taste like chicken in order to trick humans into domesticating and breeding them. They covered all their bases and even included reasons for why frogs taste like chicken, but polar bears do not. (Hint: Polar bears eat people. People do not eat polar bears.) I wish I could write down every logical conclusion and hilarious joke from the BAH!Fest, but really, my reconstructions would be nothing compared to the experience of sitting in a room filled with scientists and fellow geeky brethren while being bombarded with pseudo-science. Youll just have to go yourself one day and tell me all about it. Ultimately, after the judges deliberation and a decibel measurement of the crowds enthusiasm, 3-D doubtful Darwin left Kresge in the arms of the presenter who had explored the evolutionary advantages of a screaming baby. It was all very deep stuff. I didnt leave empty handed either though. My roommate and I, due to a little something called sneaking-out-before-the-event-is-technically-over, ended up first in line to get our posters signed!  With our loot tucked safely under our arms, we scampered back to Maseeh and the more rationally sound world of vectors, DNA translation, and the ideal gas law. Im staring at the signed poster on my wall right now and it looks pretty lonely. I know there will be many more fun-filled events in my future and, maybe someday, my wall will look just as awesome as the colorful message boards of MIT.    It's been a pretty rough week, so I took a break and drew out my struggles. For some reason (mostly the fact that I'm a media dork at heart), a video game metaphor was easiest to conceptualize in comic form, so enjoy all the references... including a couple cheesy direct nods to MIT amongst the autobiographical brainbarf in which the monsters are classes and beastly exams and self-doubt and stuff. Though I hope that bit was pretty clear.  Also, comics are fun to play around with, even though I have very little knowledge of what I'm doing. Mostly going off instinct, referencing artists I like, and hoping for the best. So I might try to include a mini strip every couple of posts, if I think of a joke or something.  A few weeks ago, I organized a 140+ person barbecue for the many alumni that have lived on my hall, going all the way back to the MIT class of 1968. East Campus has a lot of history, and my floor Tetazoo is no exception.  The alumni told stories of the wondrous pranks and adventures they pulled and that went on during their time here at MIT, and they inspired us current residents to keep pushing forward and doing great things.  I found a materials scientist who graduated in the early '70s and she told me about her awesome research in the same labs where I worked last semester.  A bunch of my friends and I sat in our lounge for hours listening to a '71 alum go on and on about stories of the origin of many of the most famous hacks here at MIT, as well as some of the incredible feats of engineering created by students just like us.  It was incredible speaking to alumni who used to be in our shoes so many years ago!  I just kept thinking how lucky we all are to have a home like Tetazoo.  Lauren S. '16 and Micky D. '79 worked on completing squanch mug and shirt orders for current and past residents of Tetazoo! And there was so much food! The alumni helped us fund the event, and Vicki C. '13 helped me organize meat catering (since I am a vegetarian and know absolutely nothing about it) while I whipped up sign-up sheets for all our hall members to help with cooking various side dishes for vegetarians and vegans.  Again, there was so much food!! Kerry N. '14 and I stayed up really late the night before the BBQ freaking out that there wouldn't be enough side dishes, and the leftovers ended up lasting us over a week!  There were potatoes and salads and green beans and sauerkraut, and some alumni even brought us some extra side dishes!  There was so much meat!!!  After a morning picking apples on the East Campus annual apple picking trip, our awesome housemasters Kate and Tom Delaney came by to grab some food and say hi to our alumni and current residents.  Kate was even sporting her awesome squanch shirt!  Marvin R. '16 and I grabbed some delicious desserts after a day of cooking and setting up for the barbecue.  Fun Fact: Marvin and I had sinus infections throughout the entire event. The event ended up being really family-friendly.  Alumni brought their children, young and old, to show them this place they lived so long ago. We ran tours of the hall, and there were plenty of games and animals for the kids to play with outside. Our Graduate Resident Tutors (GRTs), Chris F. '07 and Elizabeth F. '08, brought their baby Marie F. '31 to play in the dirt, and everyone had a great time!  A bunch of current residents, friends of hall, and kids of alumni gathered to wack our friend Austin with pool noodles.  Everyone crowded around baby Marie to admire her babyness.  Many people tried slacklining for the first time!  One of our new freshmen, Diana H. '17, is giving it a go with the help of Becca G. '14.  Jes P. '15 had a conversation with some of our alumni about what things were like "back in the day, when everything was more hardk0re."  This connect four grid was just in the courtyard. Thank you Clowns@MIT!  Will L. '16 was really excited that we had a barbecue. We had a bunch of the alumni and current residents sign a piece of plywood that we found, and eventually got this wonderful piece of culture that we wanted to place somewhere meaningful on hall.  We ended up using it to cover up a cursed mural on hall.  This cursed mural is cursed because everyone who has ever tried to finish the mural has not graduated from MIT.  Now that we have covered up the mural, those people as well as future generations now have hope (maybe).  Becca G. '14 signing the plywood that will eventually be used to cover up our cursed mural. And of course, when all was said and done, we needed to take a giant group picture to commemorate the event. This also inititated the first cross-country game of Capture the Flag ever in the history of Tetazoo.   All in all, organizing this huge barbecue was a lot of work, but it was completely worth it.  The alumni were so grateful and excited to see happy undergrads interested in their stories, and they were super excited to reunite with one another.  I'm sure class reunions are fun - but Tetazoo is our home, and reuniting people from years past who once were family and will always be family to one another is an incredible act, and I am so happy that I got the chance to play a role in keeping our family together. **All photos taken by Acrefoot (Michael) M. '11  The cats were also very excited to see all the alumni and hear the stories. If I had to explain what Junior year's been like so far.... I'd say this picture is quite accurate:(NASA/Wallops Flight Facility/Chris Perry) It's pretty much felt that way since the beginning of this semester, which explains my lack of blogging (not that that's unusual or anything...)Since I'm a visual person, I drew this little photo to explain my work this semster.  So essentially, I've been hit hard with a lot of work all the sudden, and it's terrible.Ask my roommates, I'm pretty sure they don't actually see me at all in our room since I've been going to sleep after them and waking up before them to get all my work done. You know that thing that they say where learning at MIT is like a firehose? Well, this semester I can definitely attest to that. My course load is intense this semester (most course 2 peeps I've told give me a crazy look when I tell them): 2.006: Thermal-Fluids Engineering II- Notoriously a challenging class at MIT, 2.006 is all about modeling fluid flow and heat/mass systems. That all being said, I do really enjoy the content of the class. But you should probably ask me how I feel about it once I've taken the first exam...2.008: Design and Manufacturing II- A class about different methods of manufacturing products on a larger scale. In order to gain some valuable experience manufacturing products, we get to design and manufacture plastic yoyos in this class! Definitely one of the coolest project classes at MIT. I'll be sure to make a post about this later (: 2.671: Go Forth and Measure- A class about how to measure things. Which is actually more difficult than you think it might be! It's a great class because it teaches you how to measure physical variables accurately. Because it is a communication intensive class (CI), this class is infamous for taking a lot of time to do the work (but like I said, it's useful work).CMS.350: 21st Century Journalism- This HASS class stuck out to me because I enjoy blogging. It's all about how journalism works, and we've read some really interesting published pieces. I'm also taking it with fellow blogger Michael C., which is pretty cool. These classes are all tough, but I take some consolation in the fact that I didn't consciously pick these classes out this semester. I'm locked into these because I won't be here in the Spring (more on that below!).Academics aside, I think I've had difficulties adjusting this semester because I'm getting used to some big changes in my life. The first change that I've made this semester is that I decided to change my home. I moved out of Maseeh and into my sorority house which is across the river in Boston. There were a lot of factors that influenced my decision, but I think it was the right choice for me. I've really enjoyed coming home to an actual house, instead of a dorm room. I ALSO LOVE GETTING UP EARLY (never though I'd say that...). Living in Maseeh, I pretty much just rolled out of bed 15 minutes before class and got there right on time. It's awesome being able to get to class a little earlier in the mornings and having time to decompress before lecture starts. The best thing I think though is living around my sisters. It's so nice to have so many people looking out for you, even when you don't want to inconvience anyone to tell them about all your worries. Last week, when I was having a terrible week, one of my sisters Jess left me a card on my desk telling me that I could make it through this. Sometimes it's the little things in life that help you through it all. Another big thing that's going on is that I'm currently acting EIC of Technique, the yearbook and design club at MIT. Each year, we make the beautiful yearbook that encapsulates the life of students at MIT. It's a big job, but someone's got to do it. I'm planning on blogging about this in the future, so I won't talk about it too much. But our actual EIC decided to take a semester to go do some field work, so because I'm next in the order of positions, I've assumed her responsibilities. It's been eating up a lot of my time, so it's a good thing I like everyone in that club :P I'm also super thankful that last year's EIC, Aki, is still around to help me through all the panic moments! The last HUGE change that I have in my life right now is that I'm going to be studying abroad in Cambridge University with Natnael in the Spring :) It's a wonderful opportunity, and I'm so excited to get to explore England/Europe! I'm very jealous of all my friends there now since I've awkwardly been getting all the emails about meetups... but so happy that they'll be able to help orient me to campus once I get there (and help me move in, right guys?). That being said I do still have a semester here... and knowing I have one less semester here has inspired this YOLO attitude in me, which is a little scary since I don't have much time now. But maybe that just means I'll have more wonderful blogs :PAnyways, more posts to come soon about some other things that I've been up to recently :)Here's hoping that I don't fall of the edge of the blogosphere this year!   I remember the first time I went to a market in my hometown. It was on one of those rare cold days, with icy sheets of rain washing the narrow, crowded, intertwining market streets. As I raced after my mom, who navigated the labyrinthine marketplace with the ease familiarity bestows on the well-practiced, the shouts of people reached my ears. Come and see this; its good! We have what you want, sir, trust us! I turned to look at one of them I have no idea what happened next. The world beneath me dropped. My feet plummeted, crushed against underground stone, which had formerly been hidden by the gutter I had just fallen into. I burst into tears at once, frightened, certain of impending death, screaming for my mom. Muddy water pounced on my legs with icy strength. A few minutes later, I was shivering beside my mom underneath one of the marketplace shelters, my tears replaced by the merry expectation of some consolation gift she had promised me. You probably think falling into a gutter undoubtedly filled with subterranean aliens would be enough to enforce calculating wariness on me, but I faithfully subscribe to my involuntary requirement of one superbly clumsy act every month, ranging from tumbling down two flights of stairs (grade five) to trying to sit back on a chair while holding a bottle of water and having it spill all over me (last afternoon). These moments were impressionable enough to add klutz-king to the several phrases I identify with, but thankfully, at MIT, the bulk of impressionable moments come from other sources, and I want to share a few of several with you. 1) THE MIT EXPERIENCE ITSELF:MIT is amazing has probably been said enough times to force this trite, self-conscious statement into hiding, but it constantly rings as true, and my experiences everyday intertwine with the awe MIT creates. My classes really make me work harder than Ive ever had to, an effect self-evident in me staying up late on several nights to finish aggravating p-sets, and in me having to think more extensively than high school ever needed me to. I think, without meaning to, I might have underestimated the extent to which I would be challenged by my classes. MIT is hard had been said enough times to steel my mind towards this expectation but theres a distinct line between expectation and experience, one Im more clearly aware of, one that encourages me to be focused and persistent without being overly work-consumed and alienating. I have superbly interesting classes taught by well-accomplished professors, and the amount of information they transmit each week is enormous. As time builds up and moves along, you race alongside it, barely mindful of how much youre learning until you sit back and think of how much you know this week that you didnt know two weeks ago. And even when youre not mindful of the exponential rise MIT gives your scholastic awareness, it doesnt stop you from feeling overwhelmed and just a bit proud in one of several moments you grind to a halt and realize what it truly means to be here. And if youre lucky, while heading to a dining hall for lunch one normal day after class, you might grind to a halt for a different reason altogether. Because something rather interesting just caught your eye.  Thats the MIT Alchemist Statue, toting a dark hat and shades in respect to Breaking Bad, a phenomenal TV show that recently came to an end. One more thing about the alchemist...its the solution to the puzzle I talked about last month. How exactly? Well, thats up to you to figure out. 2) A P-SET MIRACLE:What are p-sets? You know those things MIT students are constantly whining about? Those things that eagerly burst out of their lips right next to words like hosed and overworked and all-nighter in response to How are you doing? Yeah, p-sets are ferocious creatures. Nick Garcia is someone Ive gotten unbelievably close to, and we were working on an 18.01 p-set in his room about two weeks ago. A nasty-looking problem involving logarithmic inequalities stared us in the face, and we battled it separately. I kept coming up with several ways to start attacking the problem but after chasing these inspirations for a few minutes, I always met a dead end. As time shot forward, I felt my spring of ideas run thin. Nick was also stuck. I just keep trying these methods, I told him in despair, but nothing works. I dont even know how to start. Im stuck too, he replied wearily, telling me about a method he had started out with, which he had bounced around his head for some time without results. I was rigid at once, my mind spinning. Hang on. Hang on just one second... Oh my God! I nearly yelled. Yes, Nick, thats brilliant! Your idea! It works! What? Nick replied. How? So I showed him how it did, and the problem was solved. This isnt my typical p-set experience, or my typical experience with problems in general. The trick to a difficult p-set always lies in some central idea. While collaborating, you always either figure out that central idea by yourself and prod others onto that path with several hints and suggestions, or have someone who has figured it out lead you onto that path. What happened with Nick and me was different: he figured out the first half of the idea, which had evaded revealing itself in all the methods I had started out trying. I couldnt figure out the first half of the idea, but he could. And he couldnt figure out the second half of the idea, but from what he had figured out, I could see the second half. We solved the problem together. It wasnt a case of I-figured-it-out-and-now-Ill-drop-hints-so-you-can-figure-it-out. It was collaboration at its best and truest sense. Each of us held a distinct hemisphere of the solution, and somehow, we were able to unite them. Silly as it may sound, it felt truly magical. 3) A KING DOWN THE STREET:One of the unspoken MIT graduation requirements involves giving the list of 101 Things to Do Before You Graduate a serious attempt. In honor of one of the list requirements which demanded that students sample the fine burgers and frappes at a nearby restaurant called Bartleys, my roommate and I headed there last week. From the pictures, you can tell were on the right track to graduation.  It turns out Bartleys is right next to the Harvard Book Store, so after stuffing ourselves on the enormous deliciousness the restaurant offers, we headed to the bookstore. There, I came across two Stephen King books I had been trying to get for a while, and was instantly excited. Ever since I read Cell by Stephen King a few years ago, hes been my absolute favorite author, and Ive read fourteen other books by him since then. I kept babbling to my roommate James on how amazing Stephen King was, and only paused when I had to pay for the books. The cashier looked at them with some fascination, and said something that absolutely blew my mind. Stephen King? Hmm, hes going to read from his new book at Harvard University tonight. My brain took this bit of news in, digested it very carefully, agreed that I wasnt hallucinating and sent out the message that I could begin freaking out. I exploded at once, unable to help myself, letting out a stream of excited, barely intelligible words. Oh my God...you cant...you CANT...be serious! My excitement was short-lived though. It turned out the event wasnt open to the public anymore. Tickets to see Stephen King had sold out two months ago, twenty-five minutes after ticket sales had opened. Undeterred, I headed to Harvard, my awesome roommate beside me. We saw the Harvard Memorial Church, from which a heartbreakingly long line emerged. After a while, I accepted the tragic realization that I wouldnt see Stephen King. Not yet. And that was fine for now. For now, I still had his books and could still imagine his voice, rife with descriptive ingenuity, filling my head with a wonderful world in which not-so-wonderful things happened. 4) COOL PURPLE ALIENS:What weird alien creature is that? It seems to be some kind of mysterious fairy-queen, with special powers and the...no, no, nope. Its a shopping cart. The official name is actually The Hanicorn. One of my friends Hannah joined a sorority a few weeks ago, and by a nice process of mutual selection, got assigned to a Big Sister, who, to show her appreciation for Hannahs awesomeness, baked a cake that filled the entire base of a shopping cart. Hannah trundled the beautifully decorated cart around campus to every single one of her classes, letting friends dig in and grab as many chunks of cake as they could. By 5pm, we had our last class (Ancient Greek Philosophy) and the cake had still not been fully demolished.    Its definitely not every day you get to see people reach into the bowel of a pretty purple unicorn and come out holding a fat chunk of cake. 5) SEPTEMBER 12:On September 12, 2013, something infinitely awesome happened to me. Enough said. 6) COLD FRIDAY NIGHTS:The first friend I made at MIT, Isaac Cabrera, called me last weekend, asking if I wanted to hang out. Fifteen minutes later, we met beside the Alchemist and had a short conversation. We were both hungry, and Isaac suggested an Indian restaurant, which was apparently right next to my dorm. My stomach agreed pleasantly with his words of wisdom, leading to an awesome dinner of several multi-syllable meals I had never had before. After dinner, we headed out. It was one of those brutally cold Friday nights, and my T-shirt wasnt doing very well in keeping me warm so Isaac and I headed to his dorm where he gave me one of his leather jackets. As soon as I put them on, I felt simultaneously warm and hardcore. Theres something about leather jackets that give you the sense you can ride a motorcycle upside down. Wait, dont try this. Im serious. Dont. Appeased stomachs, check. Grand Theft Auto-style jackets, check. We headed out across the Harvard Bridge and into the heart of Boston. Turns out there is a world outside of MIT, one I probably need to frequent more often. We ended up walking about four miles, during which time Isaac and I spoke about classes, about Taylor Swift (yay!), about his home in California, about the awful, unpredictable pleasantly flexible Boston weather, about music. We walked past looming skyscrapers, through roads crawling with happy weekend-loving pedestrians, and ended up at the Boston Symphony Orchestra. Isaac loves operas and orchestras, and we tried to get into one of the shows, but the final show was already more than halfway done, so we decided to try again some other time. We headed back to his dorm at MIT and spent an outrageous amount of time laughing over several episodes of South Park and Family Guy. We watched it on his desktop, which was powered by a blue-glowing, unique-looking CPU he had constructed by himself from basic parts. You dont really need much to have an amazing weekend...just a person, someone you can freely embarrass yourself around. Sure, theres always work looming around the corner (its no secret that a new p-set pops up right after you submit a current one), but heres the shocker: sometimes, work can wait. It can. And when you realize this, you can create awesome experiences with the people you care about. Plus or minus a few snapshots of the beautiful city of Boston swathed in mist. On a cold Friday night.      Maybe I need to get over myself - it's been six years since I was in my friend's room at Random Hall reading that fateful email from Ben Jones informing me that I was selected to be a blogger...BUT every once in awhile I do get that itch to come back and write something. And thus I've been satisfying that urge by writing a couple of marginally helpful posts about MIT now and then :P So, I'm sitting in NYU's Bobst Library (there's nothing on my beloved Hayden, but I must say that a library in front of Washington Sq Park and an entire street of yummy treats (aka. St Marks) nearby is really not bad at all), just over a quarter done with my third year of med school, and starting to agonize over which one of these to become --  --- OKAY, so there IS a point to this entry! Here it is -- Almost six years ago, I wrote this entry - Notes on the Interview, which, based on the stat counters at the bottom, has probably been of help to a few people (1804 emailed? really? :D).  Now, I'm sitting at the other side of the table, having done some 16-odd interviews for MIT these last two years. As I head into this season with requests coming into my inbox, I thought I'd update the blog post from six years ago, with added maturity and wisdom under my belt as an Educational Counselor myself :P First of all, I want to say that I do 90% Skype interviews, and 10% in-person interviews. This happens in NYC or Boston, where apparently alums fight over you guys to interview. I never used Skype in high school, but I think Skype interviewing is another progressive innovation that allows our admission department to reach out to kids in areas where an in-person interview would be difficult. Of course, I prefer doing in-person interviews, but honestly I've felt there's not that much of a difference between Skype and IRL interviews. It's a great way for us to reach more of you, and I hope you don't turn down the Skype interview if you happen to be contacted by someone living in New York! :P Second of all, since I was such an admissions guru (lolz) when I was still in college, I offer the same 7 pointers from my previous interview, updated with new comments. Here they are: 0. DO IT!Yes, please do it. We like talking to you. Really! 1. It is not a test.I'll tell you how much we ECs know about you as an applicant - where you live, what your birthday is, where you go to school, and what your name is. That's it! I'm not comparing you against anyone and I don't know what you got on your SATs. After I write my interview report, I have no bigger bearing on your eventual decision as, say, your mom. I genuinely am curious about the person that you are, and why in particular you chose to apply to MIT. I spoke ad nauseum when I was still a blogger about your "passion" - the thing that drives you to wake up at 5 AM, the life story or experience that sets you apart from others. The interview is an opportunity for you to convey that, for us to get to know you more off-the-paper. This is not a business school interview - I won't ask you to solve any problems, and I won't ask you to solve a logic puzzle. Relax, and come prepared to simply talk about yourself. 2. Be prepared.In my previous blog post, I offered a few pointers of things to consider prior to your interview. Although I just told you to relax in #1, it does help if you do a bit of pondering before your interview. More than anything, really, it helps us if you can come prepared to talk about what your life is like and what things you are interested/do at school. I try hard as an EC to be a strong advocate for each person I interview, but I can't help you if you don't know what to talk about! (either way -- I'll draw it out of you anyways ;) but help me help you! :D) Therefore, I will advise interviewees to casually pick out a few things to talk about at your interview. Don't lose sleep over this - like I said, this is all casual, but I think if you do even 10-15 minutes of thinking beforehand, the conversation will go smoother (and hopefully will be a lot less nerve-wracking for you!) 3. Be inquisitive.Secondly, and just as important, I actually do ask my interviewees to come with 2-3 questions about MIT to the interview. I believe that we as ECs are often the most direct conduit connecting you to MIT, and the best resource (aside from these blogs!) to answer questions about what it's like to be a student at MIT. In the rare occasion that I haven't been able to answer a question, I've looked up the answer and then emailed the interviewee back, so don't be afraid to ask us questions! Just know, though, the interview is really about you, so expect to do most of the talking ;) 4. Be sincere.Two years ago, I interviewed an applicant who was (truly) interested in science and engineering, and we were talking as normal about her projects and such. However, the conversation later shifted to the sport that she has avidly played since childhood, and her eyes immediately lit up. She started talking about her sport with a fondness and fervor that I could hardly describe in words here - I happily spent the next twenty minutes or so learning the finer aspects of her sport - the nuances that she has perfected with years of practice and experience. Trust me - it's not hard to tell feigned (or even forced!) interest from true passion. Of course we like to hear about your scientific interests, given that you're applying to MIT and all, but that does not have to be where the heart of the conversation is, by all means! I'd rather hear about your exploits on the lacrosse field or the ceramic lab rather than a forced discussion of "tell me about a time when you worked in a group in your science class." 5. Be punctual.Maybe because I mostly do Skype interviews, I haven't had an issue with this (I assume people are on Facebook anyways before/after talking to me :P). In the times when I've done in-person interviews, it also helps me find you in a crowded Starbucks if you are 5 minutes early ;) 6. Be polite.Again, I haven't really had an issue with this and my interviewees have been excellent about responding to email, but please let me know if you need to change the time or if you're going to be more than 10 minutes late. The only thing that I'd add is that I do think it's a nice gesture if I could hear from you again after the interview and (only if you want, I don't really mind) after you make the final decision. I draft very detailed interview reports for my interviewees, and sometimes I do wonder where you ended up! :) 7. You can't fail!Honestly, other than this one interviewee who told me he applied to MIT "just because," gave me extremely brief answers despite my numerous attempts of getting to know him better, and appeared truly unconcerned about the interview we were having - you can't fail*. * and even I feel you did, the admission office - not me - gets to decide! I can't speak for the thousands? of ECs out there, but here's what I do when someone approaches me for an interview:-We set up a time to talk, and I ask you to prepare 2-3 questions about MIT for me. Although I'd like to ask you to come with a few things to talk about (see #2), I don't actually do this because I really don't want it to seem like a test that you have to prepare for.-We have the interview, which is a casual conversation about you and why you like MIT for an hour (you're welcome to wear a suit if you want, but honestly I don't care in the least - I wore hoodies too to my own college interviews :P but just know this expectation may differ between ECs).-I answer your questions about MIT, and I provide a general time frame of "what's next?"-I offer all of my interviewees the opportunity to use me as a resource for MIT questions throughout the application season.-We conclude the interview, and I draft a coherent and descriptive report of what we talked about during our time together for the Admissions Office. I try hard to accurately relay what you tell me, and I add in my own comments about you.-I wait till next summer when I get feedback from the Admission Office about how "helpful" my report was (I'm proud to say I receive more 5s than 4s, and have never gotten a 3 :P) --- Not to wax poetic, but I still love the speech Sal Khan (founder of Khan Academy) made at the 2012 Commencement where he said MIT is the closest thing to Hogwarts. You might not notice it as much when you're chest-deep in psets and drowning in lines of code, but take it from me (and our group of MIT alum friends in New York and San Francisco) that you only come to see this much more clearly after you leave. And since you've read this far, you have to look at this picture of a ramen burger that I (and my girlfriend, who is also a MIT alum) made last week. Best of luck :)  You: Where are you from?Me: London.You: But you...you don't...you don't seem to have a British accent.Me: Correct. Let me explain! I was born in Singapore, had a Singaporean accent, then moved to London during the summer before fifth... read more  see complete archives  Like Allan, I'm obsessed with taking notes. I'm also obsessed with handwriting. In sixth grade, Megan P. sat next to me in science class and had THE MOST BEAUTIFUL HANDWRITING I HAD EVER SEEN. Each letter was very tall and narrow, and she curled the ends of her letters so that each word looked flowery and beautiful. So, I painstakingly copied her handwriting. At some point, my letters morphed into their current form - my penmanship now bear little resemblance to Megan's. And I can write much more quickly (she was slow.)  Having handwriting that you enjoy looking at is a huge plus. When studying for exams, it's NOT agony to flip through my old class notebooks. I've also found that it's a lot more fun when there are comments written in the margins and funny quotes from the professor. So, in my lecture notes, there is a mixture of 1) abbreviated content (normal notes), 2) direct quotes, and 3) my own comments. (3) can range from questions that pop into my head that I want to ask the professor after class, to an observation that the professor is wearing funny clothes, to the fact that the kid in front of me is taking notes rapidly in LaTeX and it's making me feel bad about myself. So that I don't confuse (3) with (1), I write // in front of (3) -- those of you familiar with Java programming might understand why. On the first day of classes, I had Intro to Biology lecture (lecturer: Eric Lander) and Relativity lecture (lecturer: Peter Fisher). Both professors elected to spend the bulk of lecture outlining the class and providing motivation for learning the material (Peter Fisher actually outlined all of the MIT Physics undergraduate academic program). This makes my life as a window into the MITverse easier, because then I can let my Day 1 Lecture Notes stand in place of a blog post describing those two classes. For some reason, it took me 28 days to take my notebook to a scanner, though; sorry about that. Without further ado: 7.012 Introduction to Biology - Day 1    // When Lander says that he is a mathematician, he means that he took 2 years to get a Ph.D. in pure theoretical mathematics (from Oxford, on a Rhodes scholarship) and has never in his entire life taken an Intro to Biology class. He also means that he was on the American Mathematics Olympiad team in 1974, in its inaugural year of participation. His team placed second. More on his life story here //"Bob" is Bob Weinberg, the other 7.012 lecturer (he was in the audience for the first lecture.)        And then, what I thought was a bizarrely anticlimactic finale to Day 1 of Eric Lander's legendary 7.012 course:  Up next: 8.033 Relativity Before I show you the notes, it's worth mentioning that I've had Peter Fisher as a professor twice now: first for 8.022, then for 8.223. He's a character.  // that's supposed to say vacuum at the bottom  // Allan Adams is a string theorist at MIT, glider pilot, legendary lecturer for 8.04, and a recitation instructor for this relativity class. More on him later in this post. // "response cards" are these little remote control things that we use to answer questions interactively during lecture. The lecturer is then able to see what percentage of people keyed in what response. // the Coop is the MIT bookstore. // I didn't realize how much jargon was in these notes until I posted them. Now, big lecture hall classes at MIT are broken up into recitation sections. A few times a week, we meet as a whole class for lecture, and the main lecturer gets up and talks at us for 1-1.5 hours. On the days we don't have lecture, we have recitation instead: a class of 15-20 people, to discuss problems in more detail and resolve whatever confusions we have. Recitations are conducted by TAs: in the physics department (MIT PHYSICS <3) recitations are always conducted by a professor. This is not the case in any other department, as far as I'm aware. I have the great fortune of having Allan Adams is my recitation instructor. Notes from Day 1:    // These notes are outdated: Allan Adams is, in fact, now a person with an adorable baby named Arthur :)  One of the habits I developed in high school is carrying a notebook and pen wherever I go. It's kind of like a journal, but I don't exactly like the idea of a "journal" -- a book just about what I do or feel every day would be fairly dull to keep up, at least in my opinion. It's really more of a "idea book." Let me explain.Have you ever had an amazing idea about something, in the shower or while walking home from school, and then lost it before you could get it down on paper or somewhere else you'd remember? Notebooks were my solution to that. I have pages of melodic fragments and bits of rhyme and little sketches of silly little science projects to try. There are names of books and movies and songs to read because someone or another recommended them to me. The notebook also means I'm never bored. Do I have a few minutes? Pop out the notebook and flip through the pages, maybe jot down some thoughts about earlier entries, or look around and sketch my surroundings, or try to add a stanza to a poem from last week. Now, you might ask, what's the point of a notebook if you have a smartphone? Understand that I didn't have a smartphone in high school.I'm also kind of old-fashioned-hipster-ish about notebooks. I love the feel of ink on paper, and there's a sort of thrill in physical sketching something out and labeling it with your own handwriting and adding your own signature to the bottom and carefully putting the date in the corner. It's a sort of art form in itself, and for some reason I get an inordinate amount of pleasure from it. If you're a Redditor, check out the Penmanship Porn subreddit and you'll get a sense of exactly how nice ink can be.Now that I've proudly proclaimed one of the dorkiest parts of myself, I'll say this: simply living at MIT is a huge source of inspiration. The entire place is an idea farm more than anything else. Last week at lunch, I found myself in an animated discussion about ways to improve bicycle security. And I'm not just talking about science--the atmosphere is rich with fodder for music, art, and poetry. You'd think a place labeled an "Institute of Technology" would be pretty focused on technology, but I was so absolutely blown away by the MIT Musical Theater Guild's performance of Avenue Q (complete with puppets) that I went to see it twice, and I won't even start about all the bands, symphonies, orchestras, opera groups, a capella groups, improv comedy clubs, dance teams... For instance, here's a page of poetry from my notebook inspired by something I saw while I was crossing Massachusetts Avenue on my way back from class.  As I said before, I consider writing in notebooks an art. I mean, the point of taking notes is future reference, after all--why not make it as pretty as possible and give your future self a treat? It's a lot more fun to study for the 8.022 exam when your notes are neat and have pretty pictures in immaculate, non-smudgable Sharpie pen.  And I had to include this one even though it was technically in a problem set and not in my notebook, because I had more fun than I probably should have drawing four integrals in a row:  Okay, I just wrote an entire blog post about taking notes. I think I've filled my dorkiness allowance for the day. Allan out! Hello World!   (That's my Arduino talking, sorry. I've been having some fun teaching myself the language Processing, adding to Matlab, Python, VB.NET, and Assembly that I learned since coming to MIT.) Fun!  See?  Anyways, while I've been making things in my spare time, we've also been getting a lot of questions about the new Maker Portfolio supplement on the MIT Application this year. I wanted to try to answer some common questions here to make sure that everyone understands what we are looking for.   Q1) There is a Maker Portfolio option? Really? A1) YES! Check out the information about all of our supplements and portfolios on the MIT Admissions website.   Q2) What is a Maker Portfolio? A2) The Maker Portfolio is a description of one project completed outside of school, internships, work, or extracurricular activities. We want to see how you learn, create, and problem-solve in an unstructured environment. In addition to answering questions about your project, you may upload up to four images or a video about your project. In total, all video elements must be less than 3 minutes in runtime. Many different projects would fit the bill, for example: new origami designs, a chainmail suit, a potato cannon, a knitted fractal, or a computer program/app.   Q3) How do I submit my Maker Portfolio? A3) Maker Portfolios are submitted via the MIT Admissions Slideroom page. If you have issues accessing Slideroom, please contact the Slideroom help.   Q4) Why can't I send in more information? I have SO MUCH I want to share with you! A4) I am excited that you are excited! But we are looking for specific information about your project. The experts on the Engineering Advisory Board have a limited amount of time to review the materials that are sent in so please be concise with your answers and thoughtful in chosing which images and videos you share with us.     Q5) How do I send in my source code? How do I send you my website? How do I send you my 200-page portfolio? How do I send you other things? A5) Think of the Maker Portfolio as an "elevator pitch" about your Maker projects. You have a short amount of time to explain your project, what you did, how you did it, and why you enjoyed it. That is why the questions are very specific.  Similar to the MIT Application, we ask you the questions we want to know. Imagine that you get into an elevator with Mark Zuckerberg. You have a limited amount of time to introduce yourself to him. Probably he will get to know you better if you summarize your project instead of him reading a few lines of your code. Give us enough technical information in the Maker Portfolio questions that we understand what you did, but don't lose sight of the big picture of why you did this project and what you learned.     Q6) I have made more than one thing. Can I send you two portfolios? Or three portfolios? Or n portfolios? A6) Please only submit one Maker Portfolio. You are welcome to submit mulitple portfolios in different areas (such as a Maker Portfolio and an Art Portfolio, or Maker Portfolio and Music Portfolio), but pick your one favorite project to talk about in the Maker Portfolio. There is a question in the Maker Portfolio for you to add brief information about other projects you have made if you would like.    Q7) Is a Maker Portfolio required? A7) No! This is a completely optional part of the application. All of the supplements and portfolios are not required in any way.     Q8) Do you have any new videos of yourself talking about Makers and education? A8) Why yes, I do. If you want to learn more, you can watch a video of me speaking at the most recent Maker Faire in New York City about Makers in the College Admissions Process.  The MIT.01 course, Intro to the Institute, has been very exciting to teach, and I expect that it will be added to the extensive list of courses already existing on OpenCourseWare. To gauge the extent of how well you understand MIT and how much the course taught you, I need you to answer the following questions immediately.1) When was MIT founded? 2) If MIT was a fruit, what kind of fruit would it be? 3) What is the most appropriate way to react if you hugged the alchemist...and it hugged you back? 4) Do you agree that MIT courses are synonymous to downloading the internet into your brain? Why or why not? 5) What's the most drastic change MIT is likely to face, come 2113? 6)Over a 1000 freshmen will be admitted over the course of the next few months into MIT. How many of them will you say hi to, if a new fish is born today? 7) Are new fishes born yesterday or the day after tomorrow? Is born even appropriate? How will a course 9 student interpret this? 8)If all the buildings on campus wage a war, what building will win? 9)The number of seniors anguishing over a p-set right now is given by the letter S. The number of freshmen that have planned out their course schedules down to the final year is given by the letter F. The number of MIT alumni sitting by a window and thinking dreamily of MIT right now is given by A. Determine the number of people that will complain about the meal plan tomorrow. 10) Imagine that MIT were some large, living entity composed of highly active mitochondria, and several glycolytic enzymes that are activated by Earth-core temperature (you can tell I'm enjoying my biology class). If one of these enzymes is called Ihtfpase, why are you still reading this?Running in uncomfortable high-heeled shoes after the Discover Electrical Engineering and Computer Science program I talked about was the week of orientation. Over one thousand eager beavers yet to experience the stoic firehose were split into small groups and plunged into a tornado of activities. The free food was endless, and the ability to make friends heightened. You merely had to look one freshman in the eye without freaking him or her out to begin a conversation. It was also possible to have walked up to them, grabbed their arms and torpedoed it around firmly, screaming, HI, I'M (blank)! NICE TO MEET YOU!! WHERE ARE YOU FROM? WHY ARE YOU HERE? WHO SENT YOU? WHAT COURSE ARE YOU THINKING OF? WHY?! WHAT WAS YOUR SAT SCORE? WHAT WAS YOUR GPA? WERE YOU VALEDICTORIAN? That's typically the point everyone labels you a name that isn't very nice and leaves you alone. Of course you should never get that vocal or intrusive, but you do have to learn a few skills, such as repeating your name, state/country of origin, dorm and intended major on an infinite loop. It isn't always formulaic though. Ordinarily, when you introduce yourself to someone, they say, Oh cool, that's great!. One evening however, while I was visiting a friend at Burton Conner (one of the dorms), I had the privilege of experiencing a conversation less...usual. Person: Hey, what's your name?Me: Hi, I'm Vincent.Person: Where are you from? Me: Nigeria!Person: Where's that?Me: Africa!Person: Oh, alright, awesome.(Thirty minutes later, a freshman walks in and Person jumps up in excitement, chiming, Alright, let me introduce you to everyone! I got this! Person looks around at all of us, and tries remembering our names...)Person: Alright. Your names are... Gary, Will, Stephen, Lillian...(Person turns to me, tries to remember my name, can't remember. Person tries luck at guessing my name anyway...)Person: Nigeria?My birthday took place during Orientation, coinciding with President Reif's convocation. MIT had an awesome birthday gift for me: The Math Diagnostic Test for Physics Placement. After a fairly gloomy ninety minutes of poking my pencil at a paper, I hurried out of the exam hall and spoke with my family over the phone. It was the first time I was experiencing my birthday without them and even as I heard their laughters, and birthday wishes, and, in the case of my youngest brother, request for a laptop filled with games, I was thrown into the arms of homesickness again. That evening, I sat outside the Student Center, wondering what my siblings were breaking at home and wishing I could break it with them when I got a text message from a friend I had made during the Discover Electrical Engineering and Computer Science FPOP. He wished me a happy birthday and asked if we could hang out. We watched a hilarious movie and spent some time roaming down the rudely cold streets of Cambridge. The dreary thoughts of a faraway home vanished, replaced by idiotic intellectual conversations about monkeys in evil forests that rendered people dwarves with a single knock, about songs that determined who farted in a room of innocent-looking people, about the incoming p-sets and how much we would enjoy them (classic freshman naivete). Kayode Ezike turned my birthday around, from a festival of wistful longing to an exciting period of carefree time-wasting....and I do mean exciting. Just as Kayode and I were headed back to his dorm, we approached an incoming train, which would, in seconds, be directly in front of us. Thus came the dilemma of to cross or not to cross. And...well, let's just say that it's not on every birthday you get the luxury of a near-death experience.Several free food marathons, information sessions, and Hi, I'm Vincent, what's your name? conversation-openers later, orientation came to an end. An event called Rush followed, in which my life changed in several unexpected ways, but that's a topic for another blog post. After Rush came the dilemma of choosing classes. I had scored high enough on the math diagnostic to be recommended to take 8.012, a class commonly referred to as Physics for Masochists. I had to decide if I wanted to take it or not. I also had to decide which of the General Institute Requirement (GIR) classes I would be taking, and which of them would be through concourse . Concourse is an amazing learning community through which freshmen can take some of MIT's larger lectures in significantly smaller settings, while having eternal access to an awesome lounge in the middle of campus, to weekly discussions that explored philosophy and the intersection of science and humanities, and to free Friday lunch! Well, here are the classes I'm taking this semester:18.01: Single-variable CalculusCC.801/CC.8012: Classical Mechanics through Concourse7.012: Introductory BiologyCC.113: Ancient Greek Philosophy and Mathematics through ConcourseCC.A10: Concourse Friday Seminar.I'll talk more about them later.  Bridging the disconnect I've been very excited about coming to MIT, and those moments in which I would slip into deep thought and realize how lucky I felt to be here have never really faded. But there were times I felt a bit disconnected from the world of MIT. It just seemed so mutually exclusive from my pre-MIT life, and something about the newness of everything, from American culture to the pace of classes, sporadically terrified me. It seemed as though I had been plunged out of my safe planet, headfirst into this new colony beyond the Solar System. The strongest sense of disconnection seemed to come from the cultural difference. I was trying to get used to the people, the accents, the food, to being a minority.The atmosphere of familiarity that had defined my pre-MIT life was missing, and I felt alienated. I lived with this alienation for a few days, becoming acquaintances with just enough people to warrant a friendly wave if I randomly came across them while straddling around campus, but not enough to let those relationships become a defining part of my MIT experience. Thankfully enough, it turned out time was all I needed, and as the days spent at MIT lengthened, a pattern began to emerge--within the communities I necessarily had to frequent, within my dorm and my classes and my floor, there existed a constant group of people I frequently saw and needed to talk to. It became clear that I had always felt at ease with my family and friends in Nigeria, not because we were tied to a unifying racial identity, but because we were tied to shared experiences, to standing the test of time together, to piling up days and weeks and months within which we became a natural part of one another's lives. And with time, MIT rang of this world I knew. I got the privilege of the world's greatest roommate, James Deng. Apart from being a highly accomplished international olympiad participant with a deep interest in chemistry and a past research experience at Yale University, he's a great friend, the kind of person that sends me a text in the middle of the afternoon to see how I'm doing, the kind of person that smiles and tells me, Have a nice day of classes just before heading out of the dorm, the kind of person that asks me if I'm alright if I seem just a little downcast. A few days ago, James cooked dinner. We ate amazing food round a table and talked about our day. It's one of my best memories of this month. I could roll out of a bunch of names of people that mean a lot to me: Nick and Isaac and Hannah and Fiona and Cheng and Abigail and Rachel and Sophia, but those are just names, names behind which true, beautiful people lurk. The importance of companionship is something I may have taken for granted over the past few years, as I never got to really thinking about the value of the people that were always around me, but when I had to recreate these meaningful relationships this month, I reestablished their value. Life will always play its tune of unpredictable variation, but comfort comes from the constant truth that we can always make important human relationships, and that they can always keep us strong and happy. There was one concrete way I could tell that these people impacted me, these people I was getting to know beyond layers of names and intended course majors. They made me look forward to getting to see them in class, to p-setting with them, to merely just getting to talk to them. They made me think of MIT as a second home, not some impending degree attached to a bearable four-year timeline. They bridged the disconnect.I hope that with these past three entries, I've given you a sense of what MIT can be like, of how its energy can affect you, of how things like mystery hunts and robot projects can open your mind to new ways of thinking, but most importantly, of how everyone here, everyone you see when walking down the Infinite or running to catch a SafeRide bus, or dragging your feet to an advisor meeting, can amaze you with their interests, inspire you with their stories and engulf you with their kindness. I hope you stick around because this journey is just beginning.  see complete archives     Wednesday the Eleventh: Instead of growing up with boy bands and popular songs on the radio, my main musical intake stemmed from my dads 70s rock band CDs and video game/TV/movie soundtracks. In high school, I became friends with a bunch of theatre kids and was thrown into their world as a set designer for my sophomore fall production of The Crucible, and my eyes (ears?) were opened to the glory of musical theatre. Its second nature now to check local theatres, in this case Broadway in Boston, get excited for upcoming shows, and then promptly feel the echoing hollowness of my pockets/wallet/bank account. #collegestudentproblems But then I learned about student rush. It operates a bit differently based on the popularity of the show, but the basic principle is the same. You show up 2-3 hours before the house opens, and the box office has a limited number of as-yet-unclaimed tickets that you can buy for $20-40, lets say, instead of $80-100. First-come, first-served, and usually theyre pretty good seats. My friend Jamal E. 13 and I had tossed around the idea of trying to get student rush tickets for Wicked (the untold story of the witches of Oz) before it closed. On a whim of impulsiveness and a touch of procrastination, we decided to go for it on Wednesday. Because the show is so popular, though, you enter your name in a lottery from 5-5:30pm and a few winners are drawn.   After seeing a crowd of 70+ people toss their names (and hopes and dreams in the form of little paper balls) into this huge black cauldron, we were feeling pretty unlucky. It was as though the universe was telling us to trek back to campus and pset for the rest of the night, as we shouldve in the first place. But then they called my name. And pronounced it correctly. And we may or may not have paused for a moment, then fist-pumped and yelled YES!!! like the mature adults we are, as everyone else stared in shock/mild jealousy/confusion at the outburst They gave me a snazzy button, we got seats in row Cso close to the stage that we could see the details on the costumes, the conductor singing along with everyone on stage, and the actors expressionsand geeked out about Wicked all night. Heres the soundtrack if anyone is interested.    Thursday the Twelfth: My friend Katie W. 16 stage-managed the MIT Musical Theater Guilds production of Avenue Q, so of course I had to go see it and make funny faces at her in the booth and show my love. (That, and the fact that I try and go to every MIT show that Im not directly involved in. Yay theatre!)  I wont write a comprehensive summary because The Tech (MITs newspaper) already had a pretty good review, and you can always turn to the internet for the soundtrack or a plot summary.  Monday the Sixteenth and Thursday the Nineteenth:  With a combination of 4 classes, a UROP, and fencing already on my plate, I figured I should probably stay away from major tech theatre positions this semester... But Im still on the Dramashop exec mailing list, and have been getting updates about the Fall One-Acts. Including the time/date of the first production meeting. Basically, production meetings allow designers, producers, stage managers, and directors to meet and talk about how the show is coming together. And this one involved organizing rehearsal schedules for each of the 3 plays, figuring out when we can move into Kresge Little Theater (the final performance space), and finding somebody to be head stage manager and call the show. Which I may have signed up to do. (Hello again, ghost light.)  Im also on the tech-ninjas mailing list for the Shakespeare Ensembles production of Hamlet. And they needed an emergency stage manager, so I may have stepped in for an evening. Their rehearsals are currently table reads, which involves actors being brilliant and goofy and working out lines sans movement. This production cast a split-personality Hamlet (literally, two brilliant actors each performing half of the role) and its bound to be a good show.  For me, its wonderful how easy it is to become involved in MIT theatre without even thinking about auditioning. To be able to hang out with like-minded creative people in an institvtion known for its technicality.  So if youre looking for ways to explore sound or stage lighting cues, an artistic hankering for set painting, or a desire to keep actors somewhat on track, maybe reply to one of those email blasts or poster advertisements (this goes for high school too!). And try something new :)  Saturday is a singular bag of nacho cheese Doritos and a fun-sized bag of M&Ms.Sunday is waffles.Monday is Insomnia cookies.Tuesday is brownies.Wednesday is moon cakesThursday is an oatmeal cookie I smuggled out of dinner. Now, you may be wondering, is the above: 1) a treatise on how to gain weight and never let it go, 2) a poem of seemingly sub-par metaphors that, upon deeper analysis, actually expound on the themes of poverty, violence, and love, or 3) a catalogue of food I devoured during study breaks? I know, tough question. MIT is all about tough questions. One could certainly argue that the connotation of the word singular creates a tone of loneliness and isolation that contributes to the underlying theme of lost love. On the other hand, I would reply that it simply denotes we were too poor to have any more than one bag of chips. Most people would agree with the fact that MIT is an academically rigorous school. I know Ive spent my fair share of time in the basement study room psetting, scribbling out mistakes, and trying to untangle the parts of my brain intent on quarreling with one another. Im not ashamed to say that sometimes in lecture, new concepts can perform astounding backflips right over my head. Case in point:  Here we have Schrodingers equation in its natural habitat, my 5.112 notebook. But confusion is a good thing. To me, confusion means Im learning, and isnt that what I came here to do? So I re-read my notes, study the book, discuss it with my peers, and the cycle continues. There comes a point, however, when all the integrals and chemical symbols start to coalesce into a massive swirl of squiggly lines and dancing phospholipid bilayers. This is my brain tapping me on the shoulder and saying, Hey there friend. You know what would be really awesome right now? A little something I like to call a study break. And oh, there are study breaks. There are campus-wide study breaks, like the waffle buffet put on by SaveTFP. There are residence based advising study breaks, like the delicious box of still-warm Insomnia cookies and two tubs of ice cream that were quickly devoured. There are dorm floor study breaks, like the freshly baked brownies and blondies supplied by the friendly floor two GRTs (graduate resident tutors). And there are personal study breaks, like the moon cakes my wonderful parents shipped me all the way from California. Study breaks arent just about the food of course. They are also a time to socialize with fellow students, make new friends, and laugh about things other than whiteboards, textbooks, and calculators. Last Saturday, my roommate and I decided to throw an unsanctioned study break in our floor lounge. Here is the email we sent out to everyone in Maseeh: ** Some naysayers might call us silly. But those naysayers can take their nays and nay somewhere else. We do what makes us happy, and in our opinions, the study break was an endorphin-filled success. Don't be afraid to be yourself. It's part of what makes this campus so great. Our GRT even baked us a batch of deliciously warm chocolate chip cookies after he walked in on us laughing uncontrollably in the lounge. Seriously, these guys are the best. MIT isnt all work and no play. Lets just say there are some interesting ways to get from Darius I, third king of the Persian Achaemenid Empire, to potato skins via Wikipedia. And thankfully, there are just as many ways, despite the rumors and the misconceptions, to unwind and have buckets of fun at MIT. ** If you are bored and want to demystify the first sentence of our email, type Mr. Noodle Print (22X30) into Google. We stumbled upon this gem late one night after hours of studying. You wont be disappointed. You: Where are you from?Me: London.You: But you...you don't...you don't seem to have a British accent.Me: Correct. Let me explain! I was born in Singapore, had a Singaporean accent, then moved to London during the summer before fifth... read more  see complete archives  Sometimes, I receive e-mails from prospective students. I posted a batch of them here, and I think that the time has come to do so again. A high school senior asked: I am applying to some schools in the US for undergraduate studies...I am extremely passionate about Physics myself and am seriously considering it as a career path. However, I don't know whether I should select Physics or an Engineering course as my major during undergraduate studies. Would engineering provide a broader base from which I can then go into Physics or should I stick with Physics itself? -and- My MIT admissions interview has been waived by the admissions office, citing a lack of interviewers in my region. Will this adversely affect my chances of getting admission? Is there a way I can still have the interview? My response: When you get there, take classes in both departments and see which suits you better. Personally, I don't think that engineering provides a "broad base" for physics at all. The approaches in the two fields are very different. It would probably be much easier to start with physics and go into engineering later...but again, you should see what the professionals and professors say once you get there :) -and- That will not adversely affect your chance of getting in; don't worry about it. A prospective student said: Hi. Awesome post...Just thought I'd bring a typo to your notice. The 19th or so paragraph reads "Pulitzer Prices." and I replied: Whoops. Thanks for letting me know! My most loyal, dedicated reader (dad) gave (regularly gives) me: A list of typos from my most recent blog post.  Thanks Dad!  A prospective transfer applicant asked: What kind of research opportunities does MIT provide for its undergraduate Physics students? Why did you choose to major in Physics? Why did you go to MIT? What's bad about MIT? I responded, after taking a moment to blink the jetlag out of my eyes and wipe the sweat off my forehead: I'm sort of in the middle of a bunch of traveling, so my answer won't be able to be too long, but I'll do my best- Research opportunities: all kinds, from beginner stuff (simple coding, electronics, experimental stuff) to more advanced theoretical work for those with the requisite coursework.Why I chose physics: I liked my classes in physics, and the department here is absolutely fabulous. The professors are very invested in the undergraduates (which is not the norm for high-quality research institutions!) which to me is the most important thing. Also, there are great opportunities for doing research. I'm actually not 100% sure why I went to MIT - it was kind of a gut thing. I showed up for CPW, loved it. I also had been reading the blogs for many years, and felt comfortable with the place. There are the obvious things like GREAT UNDERGRAD RESEARCH OPPORTUNITIES! and SMART PEOPLE! etc, but in the end I think it was a feeling that I would be happy here - and certainly, I've had a good time. That said, there have been very rough patches. The atmosphere isn't "competitive", exactly, and people are good about working together, but every individual is incredibly competitive with him or herself. We're all used to being the best, I guess, so we can be very hard on ourselves. I'd say that student low self-confidence and high self-imposed pressure is the worst thing about this place. It makes for kind of a stressful environment.  A lot of people ask me about: The TOEFL. My response is always something like: I know very little about the TOEFL - much better to ask an admissions officer for this one.  A high school sophomore asked: (Paraphrased): MIT is my dream school, but people have been telling me that in order to get in you MUST take this one IB exam, and my school doesn't offer it. My school offers very few subjects. Here's a list of the classes I *can* take, and here's a list of all the extracurricular activities that I'm involved with. Do I have any chance of getting in?? I replied: Thanks for getting in touch. It sounds like you're involved with lots of awesome activities, which is great! If a course isn't offered at your school, MIT will not penalize you for not having the chance to take it. That said, with something like math, you are expected to be at a certain level when you get here - MIT recommends having some Calculus. Two things: 1) Not being able to take a specific class doesn't prevent you from learning the material. You could, for example, self-study, or take the class at a local college. 2) MIT DOES have options for people who come in with a more limited math background - there's a summer program for incoming students to sort of "catch up." Some people do come in without any calculus; it's just rare. Presumably they demonstrated, some other way, that they would be able to come in with a different background and still succeed. The real goal of admissions: determine whether you will succeed here. Sometimes that means having a particularly high level of math experience. If you can prove to admissions that you will be able to succeed, then you have a good chance of getting in :) Beyond that, I'm afraid I can't be of much help. If you're really worried, get in touch with an admissions officer.  Sometimes people ask me about: Transfer admissions. I always say: No idea, I'm sorry. Ask an admissions officer.  A high school senior asked me for: Advice on the interview. I replied: Think of it like any conversation with an interesting person. You want to find out about this person (and MIT!) but also want to communicate interesting things about yourself. Relax, and let it be casual. It helped me to think in advance about the kinds of questions they might ask (what my interests are, what I do for fun, etc) so that I wouldn't have to sit there thinking for ages. A high school senior said, as part of a longer e-mail: I really want to study chemical engineering at MIT and have no intention of choosing any other course or attending any other university. -and- I know that there isn't, and shouldn't, be a list of 'things to do to get into MIT.' Though the admissions office looks at your 'list' of achievements and capabilities and your essays and only then do they decide to interview you. So what i'm asking is how do i put my passion down on paper and my capability in a bullet-point list? What kind of events, activities etc should i be participating that i can write down in this 'list' where my passion, for what i want to become, will come through? Very alarmed, I replied: I'm glad to hear that you're so enthusiastic about MIT, but it's always alarming to hear people say things like "I have no intention of attending any other university." There are a lot of very, very good universities, that are just as good as MIT in lots of ways. Please don't limit your interests to one school - whether you get into MIT will ultimately come down to luck, so you're setting yourself up for a lot of unhappiness down the line if you close doors in your mind so early. Be open to, and be excited about, other possibilities! You're right - the admissions process is unfortunately not perfect at really getting to know somebody. And you're right that there isn't a list of things one ought to do in order to get in. Do note that they don't "decide" whether to interview you - they interview all candidates that they physically can, as far as I'm aware. So, yeah - there is no "list of things to do to get in." No one activity is "better" than another: the best activities are the ones you truly enjoy, and aren't just doing to "look good to MIT." If you do things you really enjoy, then are honest on your application (talk about the activities you've devoted the most energy/time to, etc) then I think you can trust that that excitement and commitment will come through. The answer to "what kind of events, activities etc should I be participating in?" is "the ones you care about." It's really that simple. Obviously, keep it legal and safe =P but other than that - the stuff you're already doing sounds awesome. Way too many people* ask: *people who haven't read my Q&A blog posts carefully enough Here's my GPA, my SAT scores, my list of extracurricular activities. What are my chances of getting in????? Depending on my mood, I may respond to this explaining that I am in no position to evaluate things like this, that I am not at all involved in the admissions process, that there is so much context that I don't know about that I REALLY CANNOT ANSWER THIS QUESTION. Or, I might just not answer. PLEASE DON'T ASK ME THIS QUESTION.  Sometimes, people send me: Links to fun websites or videos, "since you're interested in physics and other cool stuff like that" (to quote one HS senior.) These spontaneous e-mails: Make me happy that the world has become such a connected place. Thank you! A high school senior asked: In my country, high schools are fairly different - there were very few extracurricular activities. From what I see from the blogs, most accepted applicants were very active in clubs or teams during their high school years. Unfortunately, I do not have this option and I fear that it will hurt my chances somehow. Also, there are no advanced classes here, they are standard for all students...advanced classes also sound pretty important...for getting into MIT, and, again, I could not have taken them as my school does not offer them. I replied: Admissions evaluates an applicant within his or her context. If your school doesn't, for example, offer AP classes, you will not be penalized for not taking AP classes. That said, the committee looks for evidence that the applicant tried hard to take classes that were challenging - you shouldn't let yourself go through school feeling bored! Many students at schools without AP classes will take classes at a local community college, or online, for example.  A high school senior asked: What sorts of extracurricular things did you put on your application? I replied: The sorts of things I had on my application were - all activities that I was heavily involved with in high school. These were activities I got involved with simply because I enjoyed them. That's all you need to worry about: finding things you care about and enjoy! They won't be the same as what I did because we are different people. For that reason, I avoid telling applicants what was on my application; I'm worried about instilling some idea that there's a "right" thing to do. A prospective student asked: With the rigors of the physics major at MIT, do you have time left over for extracurricular activities? Does the academic rigor inhibit other opportunities, like research?  I replied: As with any major at MIT, the work is difficult but it's a matter of finding the right balance for you. If you pile on as many classes as it's physically possible to take, you probably won't have time for other activities. If you prioritize having other activities, then you would choose to only do two or three physics classes, probably. I would say that the academic rigor only inhibits other opportunities as much as you allow it to. Most physics majors I know, do research as well as a couple of other activities - so it's definitely possible! A high school junior asked: I'm a high school junior who has fallen in love with MIT. After reading the admissions blogs, the Tech, and pretty much everything about the school I could find, I've found out that the academics and culture and basically everything are amazing and exactly what I've wished for in a school. But there's one thing that's bothering me. I'm a writer, and have devoted most of my time into creative writing-related things. I know you've said before that it's very important for scientists to be good writers, and that there's a lot of writing involved in science, which does make me feel better, but... I'm not that great at science. Check that, I don't think I'm very good at all. I don't really struggle in any of my classes except math and science, and I'm having a terrible time in physics right now. I mean, I like science, and I'm okay at math when I understand it, but I'm more right-brained, and stuff that involves logical thinking and, for lack of better term, sciency stuff is difficult for me. I'm not necessarily worried about being happy at MIT (I really love being around people who are talented in math and science and seeing all the cool stuff they do, I know MIT's known for its really supportive culture, and I just have this really deep, unexplainable gut feeling that I would be happy there), but I'm worried about the admissions process and being asked about my interests in fields that involve math and science. My lowest grades and test scores are in those areas, and I haven't participated in that many STEM-related extracurriculars, and I'm not sure that, if I was accepted, I would decide to major in a scientific field as opposed to writing. Do you have any advice? I replied: Thanks for your message! I have a few thoughts on your situation. The first is that there's a difference between finding science hard, and not liking it. I find science hard. I find math hard. But I like both of them, and that's why I'm at MIT studying physics. I think that liking it is more important than being "good" at it, because liking will often lead becoming better. That said, as I'm sure you're aware after reading everything about MIT ever, everyone at MIT must take a certain amount of math and science. Everyone takes Intro Mechanics (8.01) and Intro Electricity & Magnetism (8.02). Everyone takes math through multivariable calculus. Everyone takes biology. Everyone takes chemistry. Freshman year, for most people, is made up of getting through those introductory classes. The reason is that the vast majority of MIT students will continue in science, and MIT believes in a strong scientific/technical background for everyone. People who really struggle in those classes have a rough freshman year. The goal of MIT admissions is to identify who will and will not be happy and successful at MIT. My inkling is that if you have been struggling in math and science so far, and haven't demonstrated a particular interest in math or science, then it will be difficult to get in, because the admissions office might be concerned that you won't make it through freshman year in one piece. That said, there's a reason that wanting to major in a STEM field is not a requirement to attend MIT. MIT tries very hard to admit a diverse student body, and part of that is building a class out of freshmen with a wide array of interests - both inside and outside of STEM. I don't think that knowing that creative writing is Your Thing would be a disadvantage, and that alone shouldn't deter you from applying to MIT if you think it's the right fit for you. MIT actually has a very good writing program, and I'm sure the department would be thrilled to get an undergraduate who wants to join their ranks. One more thing I should tell you, though. This is something you probably haven't come across on the blogs...I should probably write a long post about this. The fact is: the vast majority of people at MIT came to MIT because they wanted to pursue a STEM career. I know exactly zero people who showed up at MIT with the intention of majoring in literature, or French, or writing. I know a couple of people who ended up doing that, but only because their original major didn't work out for them. One of those people was a girl in my Lit class, who was the only French major in her entire 1000-person class. She often said that she was excited to graduate and get away from this place, because she felt like people judged her for not being a STEM major...she said that when people asked her for her major, and she said French, the response was usually something like "why would you come to MIT and major in French?" I don't know how much of this was her own insecurities and how much of it was true, but she definitely felt very lonely as one of the few pure humanities majors. Personally, I think the humanities are awesome. I love that you want to become a writer! But you should be aware that you would be one of few others majoring in the humanities; so consider whether that would be an issue. I guess in summary, my thought is: if you love science enough to be willing to struggle through it (like me), then MIT could be the right place for you. That said, you have to not struggle TOO much, because you don't want to come here and accumulate Ds and Fs. In the end, the admissions committee makes a judgment on who they think would or would not be a good fit for this place. If you really love the place, I think you should apply, be honest about yourself and your interests and your skills, and let MIT admissions decide. If you don't get in, you'll know that maybe it wouldn't have worked out after all - and if you do, then you'll be a very unique MIT student :) I hope that's helpful - sorry if it was a little disorganized, but I'm at the airport right now and just sort of word-vomiting. Let me know if you have any other questions. A high school junior asked:  What do you feel like MIT admissions is looking for? What type of person? I'd like to attend, but I want to be where I will be a good match. I don't want to go to MIT or Harvard just because they're the top schools. I replied: MIT admissions is looking for someone who will be happy at this school - that means being successful academically, but also taking full advantage of all the resources available. Therefore, they will look for evidence that you really challenged yourself in high school and still succeeded. They will also look for evidence that you are involved in activities that excite you - that you dedicate time and energy to them. They will want to see that you're the kind of person who would show up on campus and support your friends and do exciting things - not just sit in your room all day, studying. These things are purposefully vague - every admitted applicant is very different! Picture for me, if you will, all your favorite celebrities. These are people you're in awe of, people you follow on Twitter, people you hold as your role models. They are rock stars and movie stars and talk show hosts and the fabulous glamorous divas of popular culture.Got it?Now imagine that they all convened at one place to throw a huge concert, and afterwards there's a gigantic meet-and-greet. They come armed with free samples of their new music, t-shirts, posters, bracelets, branded water bottles. And they don't just want to meet you--they're looking for people to go and work for them. People are dressing to the nines and lining up around the block to get in for the chance to talk, face-to-face, with these celebrities, trying to impress them, make friends with them, prove that they're their number one fans. Get a picture of the pushing crowds and the buzz of excitement. Get a picture of the banners and posters advertising each celebrity, saying, "Come to us! Come meet us! We're super cool!" Get a picture of all the toys and candy and stickers everyone is giving away.That's what the MIT Career Fair is like. All the rock stars of the science and engineering world came out to the Johnson Athletic Center looking for new friends to make. DropBox, Facebook, Google, Apple, SpaceX (more on SpaceX later)...they were all there. And the line really did stretch all the way down to Mass Ave and around the corner. It took a long, hot hour just to get inside.  Now, being a freshman, going to the career fair was kind of like being the twelve-year-old at your big brother's birthday party. You're kind of cute and everyone smiles at you and gives you cookies, but in the end, most of the people are there for the cool kids: the upperclassmen and grad students with UROPs and past internships and industry experience and higher-level coursework under their belts. That didn't stop me and a good fraction of the freshman class from going to check it out anyway, because, hey, why not? There's no reason to pass up a chance to chat up celebrities. I had a lengthy discussion with Aurora Flight Sciences about their work with CubeSats (Google CubeSats because CubeSats are really cool and there is a special place in my heart for CubeSats because I did a research project involving CubeSats during high school). And the fair was also an opportunity to learn about new and up-and-coming celebrities; for example, today I met Planet Labs, a start-up in San Francisco designing and launching nanosatellites (incidentally, also CubeSats!) for planetary imaging. They even had a super-nifty model (I think it was a model and not the real thing) to share:  Which brings me to SpaceX. I've been using this celebrities metaphor for the career fair but I think SpaceX actually qualifies for celebrity-hood. They're the first private organization to send a capsule to the International Space Station, and probably will be the first to take humans up. You know how when NASA multistage rockets launch, the depleted stages detach and just fall into the ocean or burn up in the atmosphere? SpaceX is working on reusable rockets that will fly back to the launch pad and land vertically (as they say, the current state of rocketry is comparable to throwing the airplane away every time you make a flight). SpaceX is quite seriously working on getting a colony on Mars, and soon. They are making history, and, oh, on the side, they're YouTube stars. This video of one of their Grasshopper tests has upward of 3 million views: Here's the thing about me: I'm naturally an introvert. Talking to people In Real Life has always kind of freaked me out to some (albeit small, and rapidly decreasing) degree, and my composure will vary drastically based on how familiar with the person I am, how much I know about the topic of conversation, and how much sleep I got the previous night. Not that being an introvert is necessarily bad (check out Quiet by Susan Cain), but it does get frustrating very quickly in new settings. When I took my first steps on MIT domain as a prefrosh, I actually spent a lot more time talking to myself than I did talking to other people. My conversations with myself usually went kind of like this:Me 1: "Okay. You've got this. You're in college. Fresh start, right? You'll make TONS of new friends. You're a brand new man, and the brand new you is confident, composed, and perfectly at ease with social interaction!"Me 2: "Ah-ah-ah, don't be getting too cocky. People are scary, remember?"Me 1: "Oh come ON, making friends can't be that hard. All you have to do is say hi, shake hands, and ask some stock conversation-starting questions. What's your name, where are you from, what majors are you considering, yada yada yada. Easy peasy."Me 2: "Alright, hot shot, let's see it. How about that guy sitting at the table over there? Come on, get on it. Say hi to him."Me 1: "...Noooooo, he looks busy, maybe I'm bothering him. I'll just sit over here by myself instead."You can see where this is going. Especially because I already knew a good number of my classmates from high school or from the Research Science Institute, it became very easy to fall into the trap of not meeting anyone new. Fortunately, I recognized this early and signed myself up for a ton of clubs. If my brain didn't want to meet people, I decided I'd have to trick it into social interaction by giving it chances to do social things it enjoys--singing, for example, or dancing, and eventually I'd have to at least meet a few new people. And as orientation week wore on, passed by, and transitioned into fall-semester classes, it grew easier and easier to simply start up conversations with strangers while waiting for class to begin. The magic of making friends, of course, is that once you make one friend you often get a bonus prize consisting of your new friend's friends. Soon I was regularly waving hello to people between classes or in the dining halls.  Throw on the pressure of classes and all the extracurriculars I'd signed up for, however, and my newfound social competency got stuck fairly easily. I was trying to get through my first problem sets, sampling a slew of clubs, and losing sleep all the way. It's true that extreme MIT life is like drinking from a firehose; what they don't tell you is that doing so is sometimes not so much like a refreshing drink as it is like getting punched in the jaw with a wet and icy fist. After a few days, I found myself retreating back into my shell of social isolation. I wasn't confident that I could handle this kind of stress for what now seemed to be an endless four-year marathon to graduation, and it was with an exhausted feeling of frustration that I wandered into Maseeh Hall during lunch a few days ago and popped myself down at an empty seat to poke at the supposedly sweet-and-sour pork I'd loaded on my plate.  As I ate I slowly became aware of someone nearby speaking animatedly about how he was learning to adjust to MIT life. He had structured the way he viewed the world in such a fashion that he was in complete control of his own life, and passionately motivated because of it. It was like God was tapping me on my shoulder, saying, "Listen up! Pay attention! It's time to fix yourself up!"Long story short, I was thankfull drawn out of my shell and made a new friend. Fred, as it turns out, is a freshman pursuing Course 16 (like me), an avid blogger (like me), and a lover of language (like me). We even found out we were in the same crew for Dance Troupe. I met with Fred again over lunch yesterday and ended up discussing philosophy, the role of ethics in science, and the power of wordplay and rhetoric (I was a little late to Differential Equations yesterday). It goes to show, then, the worth and power of reaching out to people around you. I'm beginning to truly appreciate the fact that the pool of MIT resources, so readily accessible to everyone here, doesn't stop at just laboratories and research facilities--it includes the very people that constitute the community, the vibrancy and the soul of classmates sharing commonalities coming together to bounce ideas around and inspire each other to new heights.  I asked Fred, as a fellow blogger, to write up his strategies for approaching MIT life so that I could share it here with all of you (with his permission). Check it out here: The Power of Choice: Choosing Happiness.  See you around, Allan You: Where are you from?Me: London.You: But you...you don't...you don't seem to have a British accent.Me: Correct. Let me explain! I was born in Singapore, had a Singaporean accent, then moved to London during the summer before fifth... read more  see complete archives  First, I have three very exciting pieces of news to share with you: 1) Google's homepage. 2) My favorite constellation is the APOD (Astronomy Picture Of the Day)! According to the Greeks, the Pleides were the seven daughters (the constellation is also called "The Seven Sisters") of Atlas and Pleione. To the best of my knowledge, no one really knows where the name Pleides came from, so it seems legitimate to pick the possibility that I like the most: plein means to sail, so the Pleides are sailing. Before you argue with that, go spend a few hours lying outside, and let yourself rotate under the stars.  On a good night in Boston, I see an armless Orion, and the butt and tail of Ursa Major. One star of Casseiopia could represent the goddess' knee, or her head. I like the Pleides because each star is an entire mythical person. The fourth brightest star, for example, is Maia: the oldest sailing sister. She gave birth to Hermes after being raped (surprise surprise) by Zeus. She is also, in case you're interested, a B8 III blue giant with a prominent mercury absorption line. I'm sure each of Casseiopeia's body parts has a story to tell, too, but there is a much higher density of mythological life stories in the Pleides than in any other part of the sky. My computer at the NRAO this summer was named maia; it felt like destiny.  3) It is beautiful outside. 76oF (24oC, for those of you who are like me) and cloudless. It's the kind of day that indulges every one of your senses. Now, to the actual content of this post. About a month ago, Chris e-mailed me about a "Student Housing Panel.' Apparently, there were a lot of new arrivals to the admissions office, and they needed to be brought up to speed about student life at MIT. Since I know a few things about being an MIT student, I was invited to sit on a panel and answer some questions.  I had no idea what the questions were going to be. I imagined a fact request, like "what is the housing process like for your dormitory?" or "what is the difference between 8.01 and 8.012?" -- but instead had to improvise answers to (paraphrased): 1) What is your name / year / hometown / high school / major / residence?2) Why did you choose MIT?3) What's your favorite thing about MIT?4) Have you ever had a UROP? If so, what was the experience like?5) Why did you choose your dorm/living group and how has it shaped you?6) What are your biggest regrets from your years at MIT?7) What activities are you involved with, and how have they shaped you? Admittedly, (1) was pretty straightforward, but the rest -- woah. Deep questions. Unfortunately I didn't have a notebook with me, so I whipped out a sheet of paper (this article, which my mom sent to me) and began to scribble on the back. When it was my turn to speak, responses came babbling out of me, although I'm not sure what exactly I said. I just hadn't had to articulate answers to those questions before. I'm glad someone forced me to: I think that they're important ideas to have in my toolkit of Answers To Questions That Someone Might Ask Me Someday. Now that I've had a little more time to reflect, here are more concise, confident answers. 1) Anna Ho. Class of 2014. Hometown: it's complicated. I was born in Singapore, and moved to England when I was nine and a half, where I picked up an American accent. American School in London (hence the accent). Physics. French House, a living group in New House. 2) To be perfectly honest, I don't know. So, I'll speculate, the same way a historian might speculate about a subject's motivations, based on context and minimal historical records (I don't think I left anything in writing stating the reasons why.) I remember feeling conflicted, because I wanted to emerge from college a well-rounded individual; I was concerned that an MIT education would leave me humanities-less. I remember really admiring everyone I met from MIT, and admiring all of the bloggers on the admissions site. I wanted to be like them. I loved everyone I met during CPW, even though my tonsils rivalled golf balls in volume, and the person I spent the most time with over that weekend remains one of my best friends. I also remember perceiving a lack of pretention about MIT: no one seemed to care how you dressed, what color your hair was, where you came from, who your parents were, how athletic you were. Everyone just wanted to do, and talk about, interesting things. I remember having a lot of respect for what people admired in each other: you would be praised for putting a car on the roof of a building, or for being really excited about your research, or for taking time out of your busy day to be a supportive friend. I remember a conversation back in London, with my writing seminar teacher; when I told him that I was considering going to MIT, he said: "oh, MIT! They have a great writing department! Did you know that?"  Ultimately, I think I picked MIT because, after reading about past MIT students for years (since 8th grade) and meeting current and future ones, I decided that I wanted to be an MIT student. I wanted to be good at the things MIT students admired each other for. I looked up to every individual on that campus, and maybe that made me think going there would turn me into the best person I could be. But that's just an educated guess. Another possibility is that I just made a gut instinct decision. And that's worked out fine! 3) The answer almost everyone gives is "the people," so I'm going to talk about a couple of other things. The energy. You walk down the hallway, and everyone is walking quickly, with purpose. You catch snippets of excited conversations about projects and stories and wish you had time to listen to all of them.  MIT changes us. During orientation, I meet freshmen who are just off the boat from high school, where their identity was The Smart Kid. They are keen to impress. They arrive, and insecurity floods in: everyone around you is OUTSTANDING so you feel very ordinary, and scramble to become distinct. At first, you don't know how you want to distinguish yourself. You talk loudly about a pset score, or about how late you were up studying, or jump to correct people on little insignificant techncialities (spoiler alert: none of these things are particularly impressive.) For some reason, it took me a while to get that admiring others and feeling proud of myself are NOT mutually exclusive. It took me a while to learn that I stand out in ways independent of where I would fall on an IQ or GPA spectrum. I've learned, for example, that I am very good at infecting others with my excitement for a topic, and that I have a knack for public speaking. One of my friends, on the other hand, is not fond of public speaking at all, yet has incredible to-die-for self-discipline. She exercises all the time, does her grocery shopping regularly (WOW), eats very healthily (WOW), and sleeps well. I've seen her study for a test every day for a week, or every week for months. I would never say that she's the "smartest person I know," but I've also learned that that's a meaningless compliment, when everyone is intelligence in such a vast array of ways. I was very attached to The Smart Kid title in High School (it's addictive) and being stripped of that title on MIT campus can be a painful, painful process. But here, I've had the incentive - the need, really - to distinguish myself in healthier, more productive ways, and I think that that's made me much better-equipped to enter the world. I also like how much innate respect MIT students have for each other. When I meet someone, I assume that he or she is very competent, kind, and has my best interests at heart. I know that this person has pursued passions in an exceptional way - or, frankly, they wouldn't be here - and I am excited right off the bat to learn what that story is.  I like how much responsibility MIT students take for - and give to - each other. The spirit here is that we're all very intelligent competent people, who care very much about our unique campus culture, and therefore we want a big say in administrative changes. We have a HUGE role in managing our housing system: within our dorms, we basically run CPW and FYRE and rooming lotteries. In French House, we even feed each other, through our daily (minus Saturday) cooking system. We take care of each other, here. 4) Yes, and mixed. My first UROP was freshman year; I worked in Saxelab, after introducing myself to the PI following a BCS colloquium. I interviewed for the position, then worked with two post-docs for a few months on a project studying the eye movements of autistic subjects while they watch complex social scenes. It was totally fascinating in theory, but the day-to-day work was tedious; I combed through videos, trying to find appropriate scenes for the study. I didn't learn a whole lot about the brain. In retrospect, I wish I had started the project over IAP or over the summer, so that I could have devoted more time to it. Exposure to the lab did give me a sense for what behavioral study work is like, though, and I learned that I wanted to try something else. Next up: summer after freshman year, I did a computational biology-esque UROP with a grad student in the mechanical engineering department (he was quite the polymath.) Again, that was really interesting -- but I didn't click particularly well with the mentor and in the end it didn't really go anywhere. So, again, another good learning experience, but meh. Everything changed when I did an REU that I absolutely loved. This was really my transformative research experience - for some people, that takes place through a UROP on campus instead.  5) The "how it has shaped me" is much easier than the "why I picked it." How I ended up living here isn't a very romantic story. I didn't get much of a chance to explore the dorms: I was sick with tonsillitis during CPW, and on crutches during REX. I had studied French all my life and had spent a lot of time in France, so was definitely drawn to the cultural aspect, without really knowing what I was in for. Either way, somehow I ended up here, and really could not be happier about it! Now: how it's shaped me.  At home, my major responsibility was to myself: work hard and develop a set of interests, while Mom and Dad take care of necessities. I stayed far away from student government activities, although I did run a few clubs. My robotics team was probably where I developed my strongest sense of responsibility for others, but at the same time there were always adult mentors who REALLY ran things: organized trips, encouraged us to go out and find funding, etc.  French House runs itself. We manage our own budget, debate at house meetings how and when to spend our money. We buy our own kitchen equipment, cook meals for each other, split up the cleaning chores. We plan, organize, run freshmen orientation activities, and ditto social events like dinners and parties. In French House, I've learned how to feel responsible for my family: things literally would not happen here - we would not have dinners, we would not have kitchen equipment, our living space would not be clean - if we stopped taking care of it, and each other. Almost all of the upperclassman members of the house have some kind of house government position: this year, I'm an orientation chair and sports chair, for example.  I'm glad that I didn't pick a living group by trying to find the group of people most similar to me. If I did, I wouldn't have ended up in French House. Sure, it's important to live with people you feel comfortable with, but learning to live with people who are different from you is also important -- and something you will rarely have the opportunity to do, after college. We have a huge diversity of residents here: a range of majors, interests, hobbies, habits, personality types, and as a result, I've been inspired in ways that I would otherwise never have been, and become best friends with people I would otherwise never have met. > 6) Regrets. This is a really hard question, because any regret can be cast as an important life lesson. I do regret not holding onto more my friendships: there are people I talked to a lot freshmen year, who I now wave to in the infinite every now and then. I regret not making a point to exercise regularly. Fortunately, the long walk to New House and the hike up the stairs to French House has kept me reasonably in-shape, but I wish I had made a point of establishing an exercise habit. Other than that, I can't think of anything I really wish I had or hadn't done: I definitely made a lot of mistakes, but I think they all needed to be made.  7) This could be a novella. I won't provide a laundry list. Instead, I'll focus on two that have had totally unexpected but transforming outcomes: -Musical Theater. I've performed in two musicals at MIT, and the performer's confidence I've gained as a result has made me a MUCH better teacher and public speaker. These are skills that I've used since to give talks on my research to the public, an activity that ultimately shifted my career path from doctor to astrophysicist public outreach-er.  -Dorm Government. I stayed far, far away from dorm government during High School. I sort of just didn't want to know, I think, and felt like I had better things to do. Here at MIT, I've gotten very heavily involved with politics: I'm the president of my dorm, serve as a student rep to the CUP, and have developed a very strong feeling of responsibility for my community as a result. I've been through some rough patches, but have become so much more adept at navigating the waters of decision-making and consulting and knowing when to ask for advice and when to just make a decision. My spine is much tougher, I've learned to stand up and fight, how to respond to emergencies. I've also gotten to know a much wider cross-section of the campus community. I've learned that at the end of the day, we're all MIT students, and which dorm we live in should not limit the radius of our circle of friendships. It's been stressful, not going to lie - but a total privilege, and I'm now much more aware of my personal strengths and weaknesses.. And hopefully a much better leader. After my term is over, and I have more time to reflect on the experience as a closed system, I'll write a more detailed post about it.  - When the panel was over, my head was left buzzing with how much of a roller-coaster college has been. What an amazingly high density of learning and changing we do in these four years. And what a weird feeling, to think that I will bow out of this universe in under two semesters.  If you've never played two truths and a lie before, all you have to do is guess which of the three things I'm about to say is a lie: 1. I am Iron Man.2. MIT Isnt all happy days and sprinkles.3. MIT kids are perfect. Go ahead, take your pick and then read below for the answers.   Truth is...I am Iron Man.  Well, not really.  Not yet.  But I could be.  You could be too.  Or you could be something else.  It's up to you to decide and no one can tell you otherwise.  Anyways, its great to meet you, unknown MIT Admissions Blog reader!  (Feel free to comment or shoot an email to be less unknown!).  You probably have a passion for science and technology that shines in your everyday life.  Or you could be passionate about the arts...or sports, or dance, or writing, or anything else.  You might be having a bad day, or you could be having a great day.  It could even be your birthday today, in which case HAPPY BIRTHDAY!  Truth is, I have no idea who you are or what youre like, but Im here to welcome you and tell you who I am and what Im like.  So, welcome to MIT.  Welcome to the party.  I fell out of my parents' nest in New Jersey and flew (literally) to MIT.  The plane ride was only 30 minutes, so rather than watching 1/4th of a movie, I started thinking as I looked out the airplane window down onto the earth.  I thought about my parents.  Theyre so proud of me.  First generation Latino and the first from my school to be accepted to MIT.  Its more than just motivation.  Its conviction.  My mom, my dad, my three younger brothers, my grandparents, my high school teachers, my friends, and my mentors all contributed to make me who I am today.  Now, I was being thrown into this boxing ring called MIT where I would pit myself against the world.  Half hour passed, I got off the giant winged mechanical beast that brought me to a new world, and I rode in the backseat of a lesser sized yellow overpriced mini beast until I arrived at MIT.  I checked into my room at Simmons, got my MIT ID from the Student center, and proceeded to explore this mysterious jungle known as MIT.  I wish I had a fedora and a whip (props if you have them on your first day).  I'm loving it!  I started my FPOP (Freshman Pre-Orientation Program) the next day and over the course of a week, I worked in a group with two other amazing MIT students (including another *ahem* MIT blogger Vincent Anioke) to make a Lego robot.  Behold Wall-Es ancestor!!  After FPOP week was orientation week.  After orientation week was rush week. After rush week was the first full week of classes.  This week is career fair week. (Am I spelling week correctly?  Week is starting to sound weird after saying week so many times.)   Truth is...being at MIT isnt all happy days, sprinkles, and quesadillas (scratch that, there actually are a lot of quesadillas here).  Unfortunately, no matter how many quesadillas MIT has to offer, things can and do go wrong.  Its a law that holds truer than the Law of Conservation of Energy.  Its called Murphys Law, which states that "anything that can go wrong, will go wrong."  Luckily, there is a much lesser known law which states that "every bad thing that happens has a positive outlook, but only if you want it to". Example  If I have my key in my pocket and it is the first day Im at MIT, then I lose my key and have to buy a new one.Counter - I got a really nice lanyard from a free event that said "MIT Alumni" so now not only will I not lose my key again, but now some people mistake me for a grad student :D Example  If we happen to be going to the beach early on a specific day, my alarm clock will decide to not work on that day and I will be left with an unused bottle of sunblock.Counter - I saved money on sunblock and spent the afternoon at the Media Lab building connections for potential UROPs. Example  If its the first day of my first year of college classes, I will get up nice and early but I will have misplaced my MIT ID and not only miss out on breakfast but be late to my first college class.Counter - Now I know to keep my MIT ID in my wallet at all times and I leave for class at least 15 minutes before the hour (I live in Simmons, a fairly decently walk). In short: the glass could be half empty, but you could easily just, like, pour more water in.  I mean, that's what glasses are for.   Lie is...MIT Kids are perfect.  Were not perfect.  Were not machines.  Were not Terminators or Watsons or iRobots.  Believe it or not, MIT kids are human beings. Go ahead and open one up  we have the same blood and fleshy guts that you do (dont actually do that, just take my word for it).  People have faults.  Noone is better then everyone else at everything.  But once youre here, it doesnt matter how smart you are or what version of physics or math you take.  All that matters is how much you want to learn and what youre willing to do to learn.  MIT has its way of making you think outside the box and pound your head with the nearest frying pan until you have a Eureka moment where life and the universe suddenly makes sense.  You'll get this a lot from doing PSets.  Those moments are so unique and life-changing that I even documented how I felt during my first one:   tl;dr We felt like this:   And there you have it.  Two truths and a lie.  Thanks for playing. Sincerely, Erick Things took a turn for the worse. Quickly. Very quickly. --August 17th was a Saturday, and it started out as a good one. I was awoken by the indignant rumble of my ungrateful stomach, which was screaming for food. Not wanting a fight this morning, I ran to the kitchen, and dug through boxes of cereal and bunches of fruit until I found something that made my intestines hum melodies.  The morning plowed its way through the corridors of time, and I ricocheted around the house, asking questions, trying to see what I had forgotten, what shoelace was missing, what sock was hanging around quivering in fear and hoping not to be left behind.  It was time to return to MIT, and I was pretty excited. I had already formed the visions in my head of what the return would be like. A chance to be gracefully swept (or brutally pummeled, depending on what day of the week it was) through the current of people that paced the Infinite. The chance to lounge around with friends and take turns expressing vast anger with problem sets no doubt carefully engineered in some underground pain laboratory. These happy thoughts kept me company as I stuffed my things into four huge airport-bound bags...and then it happened. I heard it. For a long time, I did. It kept me rooted still, fixed to the floor, listening to my heart thump, waiting... Things didnt get any better when I arrived at the airport. We drove there in slight glum, the events of the past hour hanging over us like a palpable shroud. I was already dangerously close to being late, so I quickly checked in two of my luggage bags, hugged my uncle and his family, and ran through the security checkpoint, after heaving two non-checked-in-bags onto the conveyor belt that would glide through the security scanners.  I passed through security, got my bag, and was about to leave when...  Wait...bag? Bag? Shouldnt there be...bags? Oh dear.  I spun around. Yup. Somehow, sitting obnoxiously away from me, on the other side of the security scanner, was my second bag, which must have somehow fallen off. What was happening? Five minutes left until the flight. My uncle and his family waving at me, unaware that it wasnt over yet. Oh boy. Several unsavory expletives and a second security-scan later, I was running with my two luggage bags towards the plane. From speakers above, someone boomed out my name. Everyone had boarded. The plane was ready to take off. I was keeping everyone waiting. Luckily, I made it in time, and waded down the length of the plane, my bags smacking the knees and feet of several already irate-looking passengers. I finally collapsed onto my seat, breathing out in exhaustion. Classic Vincent, I muttered to myself. Beside me, an elderly woman glared. My bag was on her feet.--Campus Air When the plane landed, I went into an undignified battle with my four luggage bags. I still wonder how I managed to move all of them at once from the baggage-claim room to outside the airport where Boston Summer Heat rained sulphuric acid lavished hugs on me. I found a taxi. 290 Massachusetts Avenue, I told the driver, as I wrestled my bags into the trunk. 290 Mass. Ave was Random Hall. Naturally, I was dropped somewhere close to Random, and because I still hadnt figured out that the best thing to do in a strange new place was to ask for help, I decided that I could identify Random, and began a brave ten-minute walk in the opposite direction. I was just about to collapse on the side of the road from exhaustion and lay there until some dog came by and decided to bite my leg off when a graduate student named Peter saw me. Young, wide-eyed seventeen-year-old boy covered in sweat and dragging two stacks of four bags. Freshman? he asked. I nodded. Yes, hi, I'm Vincent, just got here...Im looking for Random. Oh, he replied, looking amused. Yes, um, this is the wrong way. He helped with the bags, led me to Random, and wished me the best of luck at MIT. The world needs more Peters. -- I spent the rest of the day wandering around. I got the key to my room, and saw a collection of books outside my dorm and...well, lets just say, they had "interesting" titles. I ran to the Student Center, got orientation information from some nice people, and a list of 101 things to do Before I Graduate. I had lunch at Subway. I saw a cat meow at me, and meowed right back.  That evening, I was on one of those benches outside the student center, watching the sun sink lower. From where I sat, I could see the Alchemist Statue, curled up on the floor, staring moodily at the building across, as though afraid to head there for a Biology Final it hadnt studied for. I watched two students race. One of them pumped his legs as hard and as fast as any legs could move, but he didnt win, which wasnt surprising, since his competitor was racing on a bike and laughing. Some girls passed me, saying something about registrations. Tourists took photos of the student center.  I felt it sink over me, the awe of MIT, the awe of its history reaching up from invisible depths to welcome me with open arms, the awe of what lay ahead, the awe of what was coming. I felt happy.--Two Busy Weeks, part 1I soon found out that time raced at MIT, as though trying to keep up with the energy of students. A thousand events happened at the same time, from shenanigans I can only hint at, to information sessions, to barbecues, to ambitious projects. International Orientation flew by, during which I discovered that the Red Sox and clam chowder make Boston happy. I met a ton of students, and soon found that my accent posed a slight problem. Sometimes, I would speak too fast, and would often have to repeat myself to be heard. Sometimes, people didnt even bother trying to figure out what I was saying. I remember a conversation that went like this. Person: Where are you from? Me: Nigeria, you? Person: California! How do you like it here? Me: Its awesome. What course are you thinking of majoring in? Person: Sorry, can you repeat that? Me: What course are you thinking of majoring in? Person (didnt hear me the second time): Oh, okay, that's cool.--I participated in the Discover Electrical Engineering and Computer Science FPOP, and was grouped with two students, (one of them, Erick Pinos, is actually an admissions blogger too, and is totally awesome!). Our group, alongside twelve or thirteen other groups spent the next 5 days building Lego robots and programming them to move around a maze with the help of photo-sensors.   During this FPOP, we had the craziest mystery hunt ever, engineered by an awesome grad student. Basically, we had to unscramble a really long anagram which led to a website that revealed an entire page of coded words. We decoded the page, and it led us running to the Infinite Corridor where we found a map that pointed to four places on campus. After a zigzag through the lumbering Stata Center, two floors of a humanities library, and some corridors I had never seen before, and after lamenting our collective cluelessness at a paper filled with qs, ws and asterisks, a sheet strewn with meaningless numbers, and torn newspapers containing clue-potent images unmasked only by the right kind of light, we still werent able to finish the hunt, despite the fact we had spent six hours on it. They had to tell us everything else, including where the final clue lay. And now, I want you to tell me where the final clue lay. Can you figure it out with the following:1) The 3rd 3-digit even palindrome divisible by 1112) An Illuminati Ambigram that is supposedly a hint. Definitely somewhere on campus. But where? Boston Festival of Indie Games! The 2nd annual convention hosted here in Boston to celebrate gaming, and it is completely free to the public. (But actually it was awesome, and much like a baby-PAX  a video game conference started in Seattle that now has a Boston branch. I went last year and plan on going this year. Its freaking awesome.) I woke up at around 10am, got my pass and a guidebook around 10:45, and headed over to 10-250 for the keynote. The lanyard has The Behemoth logo on itthe company that created one of my favorite arcade games, Castle Crashers.    The Videri String Quartet, a local group, played music from the games Dear Esther and Journey. Live video game music is one of my favorite things. (Also kind of humorous how the remnants of an 18.02 lecture are on the chalkboard.)  The keynote speaker was Robin Hunike, the designer and executive producer of the game Journey. Her talk reminded me how much meaning I derive from video games, and made me question whether I should abandon the biological sciences and devote my time to animation or drawing concept art. Yeah... I guess I get inspired pretty intensely by media. But how can you not with promos like this?  She discussed the rise of independent games as a product of wanting to make something youre proud of and being totally in control of that process. All great games come from a feeling inside a person, something beyond just finding a niche market or putting previously successful ideas together. And she went on to advise how every developer ought to:   After being filled with warm fuzzy creative feels, I met up with my friends Jamal E. 13 and Dalton H. 13 and wandered both the digital and tabletop expo floors. Both rooms were a montage of indie gaming goodness, with a mixture of students, independent designers, and small companies exhibiting. The digital expo floor included all console, PC, and android/iPhone games, as well as other independent gaming platforms. I think this may be my favorite transformation of the Johnson ice rink so far.    And now, for a montage of games: Tiny Brains, a co-op puzzle game being released for PS4 and Steam. You play as small mice trying to escape a lab and defeat little mutant chicken enemiessuper fun.  Dalton playing with Sifteo Cubes, a new type of touch-screen gaming that allows you to play pattern/memory-based competition games with other people.   Dalton and Jamal puzzling through Color Zen, an android/iPhone game where you match colors in a specific order to clear levels. Its really easy to play one level or twenty, and very low pressure.    And then, here's the tabletop expo floor, on the 2nd floor of the student center. This includes board games, card games, and possibly some RPGsbasically anything that doesnt involve a screen.   Ice cubris! Its like Tetris/reverse-jenga but with ice cubes. Kinda messy, but it looks easy to set up anywhere.   Time Keepers, a board game in which youre trying to restore major events to their proper locations in the timestream. (Side note: I really enjoy the happy expressions of all these people; where learning to play a new game is an incredibly positive experience no matter what your background is. Im a true proponent of the idea that gaming brings people together. Cheesiness over.)  And to finish off my day, I headed back to 10-250 to listen to Ethan Gilsdorf, the author of Fantasy Freaks and Gaming Geeks, and Brian OHalloran, an actor most prominently known as Dante in the Clerks movies who is also a gamer, talk about how Dungeons and Dragons changed their lives. It was a pretty lighthearted talk, both of them emphasizing the fact that D&D helped them find nerdy friends instead of being outcasts in middle/high school, fostered creativity through character development, world building, and story creation, and held such gravitas during their young-adulthood but now has an uncertain future due to the advances in technology.  Ethan Gilsdorf showed a Super 8 film that he shot of him and his friends playing D&D in 1981. Very cool and kinda surreal for me, because it was actual footage of a scene that my dad had described to me so many timesof him and his friends just goofing off in a basement and gaming.  And one of the most random coincidences was that Brian OHalloran actually gamed with the current MIT professor Junot Diaz back in high school, and, in fact, played story modules that he wrote.  If you even have a mild interest in video games, tabletop, or gaming culture, and are in the Boston area, definitely check this convention out. At the very least to experience an environment where so many people who are passionate about something dorky gather together to just celebrate it and collaborate.  And, if you want more information about people playing video games or tabletop, try checking out some of these YouTube channels: HankGames, Tabletop (by Geek and Sundry), Team Hypercube, or TheRunawayGuys.   You: Where are you from?Me: London.You: But you...you don't...you don't seem to have a British accent.Me: Correct. Let me explain! I was born in Singapore, had a Singaporean accent, then moved to London during the summer before fifth... read more  see complete archives  In 1965, the U.S. government awarded George (MIT Class of ~1923) and Charlotte Blonsky a patent:  In case reading the crumbly Times New Roman is a struggle: their patent was for an "Apparatus for facilitating the birth of a child by centrifugal force." You are familiar with the centrifugal force. It's the force that makes you slam your head into the car window when you turn a corner sharply, and makes the seats in this ride swing outward. In general, if you ride around in a circle, you feel the centrifugal (fictitious) force yanking you outwards. So, the idea behind this apparatus is that if you spin a mother around in a circle with her head at the center, the baby will come flying out, to be caught in a net. The obvious question now is: was a baby ever delivered using this apparatus? For better or for worse, no one seems to know. 32 years after Mr. and Mrs. Blonsky got their patent, they were (post-humously) awarded an Ig Nobel Prize, alongside such distinguished visionaries as Steve Penfold of York University in Toronto ("The social life of donuts: Commodity and community in postwar Canada") The Kansas and Colorado State Boards of Education ("for mandating that children should not believe in Darwin's theory of evolution any more than they believe in Newton's theory of gravitation, Faraday's and Maxwell's theory of electromagnetism, or Pasteur's theory that germs cause disease") and Takeshi Makino of the Safety Detective Agency in Osaka ("for his involvement with S-Check, an infidelity detection spray that wives can apply to their husbands' underwear.") You get the idea. If you don't, here's the description of what the Ig Nobel Prizes are awarded for: "achievements that first make people LAUGH, and then make them THINK." Here's the official website, and here's the Wikipedia page.  This year, the Ig Nobel Prize official ceremony was held here in Cambridge - and, on Saturday September 14, all of the award recipients gave five-minute lectures (followed by a Q&A session) at MIT, in 26-100 (I sit through biology lecture in 26-100, three times a week!)   It was impossible to pass up, so I went along, and brought my little sister. She was excited to be there!  In the opening moments, Marc Abrahams (the man behind the whole Ig Nobel thing) asked for a volunteer who had a watch. I had a watch. My hand shot up first. (In my boyfriend's words: "Classic Anna.") Marc Abrahams' eyes settled on me, and I got to take a seat on stage. Next, he asked for people who could make loud noises: one guy made a clicking sound with his tongue, and another woman pulled out her ukelele (unclear why she had it with her...this will remain one of life's mysteries.) We made a good team:  (Photo Credit to John Carr) I introduced myself to the other two, and found out that the man lives in Italy (I think it was Italy?) and the woman lives in the Netherlands: both are in Boston, traveling.  Our mission: to let the speakers know every time a minute passed, and to really let them know once their five minutes were up. Every minute, I cued the other two, who responded by making their noises:  Another mission not mentioned in the job description: entertain the audience whenever a lecture is interrupted by technical difficulties. Fortunately, my new Dutch friend is a fabulous singer, and my Italian friend is a fabulous dancer. I can't sing, or dance. So, my contribution was to wave my hands in the air. Some of the Ig Nobel Prize recipients jumped out of their front row seats to help us out, and the results were pretty spectacular:   Good times. Now, to the content: there were seven lectures (ten prizes were awarded, but one post-humously, and two to groups who couldn't make it*, **.)  *The president of Belarus for "making it illegal to applaud in public" and the Belarus State Police for "arresting a one-armed man for applauding" ** A group from Thailand for "the medical techniques described in their report 'Surgical Management of Penile Amputations in Siam'...techniques which they recommend, except in cases where the amputated penis has been partially eaten by a duck"  In no particular order: 1. The Ig Nobel Prize for Biology and Astronomy (not usually dished out as a joint prize) was awarded for "discovering that when dung beetles get lost, they can navigate their way home by looking at the Milky Way."   2. The Ig Nobel Prize for Physics was awarded for "discovering that some people would be physically capable of running across the surface of a pond -- if those people and that pond were on the moon."  3. The Ig Nobel Prize for Medicine was awarded for "assessing the effect of listening to opera, on heart transplant patients who are mice." Here's the crew:  4. The Ig Nobel Prize for Archaeology was awarded for "parboiling a dead shrew, and then swallowing the shrew without chewing, and then carefully examining everything excreted during subsequent days -- all so they could see which bones would dissolve inside the human digestive system, and which bones would not." Unsurprisingly, the representative was wearing a lab coat. Turns out that he owns a cool company, and has an adorable daughter who jumped up and helped him hand out shrew-shaped lollipops.   5. The Ig Nobel Prize for Probability was awarded for "making two related discoveries: First, that the longer a cow has been lying down, the more likely that cow will soon stand up; and Second, that once a cow stands up, you cannot easily predict how soon that cow will lie down again." Excerpts:    6. The Ig Nobel Prize for Psychology was awarded for "confirming, by experiment, that people who think they are drunk also think they are attractive." 7. The Ig Nobel Prize for Medicine was awarded for "discovering that the biochemical process by which onions make people cry is even more complicated than scientists previously realized."  They got a bunch of volunteers to come on stage, and made them cry:  - The Blonsky couple was also honored; the opera written about their invention was shown in between talks. It was very, very strange:   At the end of the ceremony, I got to stand up and take a bow - and was awarded a book for my troubles. So, now I can officially say that I have been awarded a prize at an Ig Nobel ceremony :) (Also, the rest of John Carr's photos of the event are here, on flickr.) see complete archives  Hey! Remember me? No? Hi. I'm Elizabeth. I graduated last June. But here we are, me crufting on the blogs, you not knowing who I am. I never officially said goodbye, and I STILL have that post. I'm working on it. Proof:  (This is how I brainstorm most of my doodle entries, for those of you who are curious.) But in any case, if you don't know who I am, all you need to know is that I love science (and other things, like bluegrass music, Parks and Rec, and the Oregon Ducks). Another thing on the list of things I love is my brother, Ryan. He is 11. This summer he told me he didn't like science. My reponse?   When you're at a place like MIT, it's easy to forget that people have actually managed to pull off the incredible feat of making science unbelievably boring. So while I was at home this summer, I did as any nerdy sister would do to remedy the situation of a little brother (who is a total ham) not being jazzed about science. I set up a fake science show where Ryan and I would do experiments in our backyard. It's very nerdy. It's very dorky. It's very embarassing. And it's on the internet. Here is episode 2: There comes a time in everyone's MIT experience, from the application process to being on campus, when you are starstruck. Starstruck by the achievements of your friends, current/future classmates, professors, or even housemasters' dogs (confession: I'm not entirely sure whether the dogs have gained any fame other than being incredibly cute). After which, you feel the slight urge to huddle under a blanket with a warm cup of tea and mutter to yourself, "what have I even done with my life?" Oftentimes, this moment occurs as soon as you arrive on campus. Or in the middle of your third essay prompt on a college app. And it'll probably happen more than once. I had this moment most recently while sitting in my 18.03 (Differential Equations) lecture. The professor had casually remarked that the rest of the integration is trivial, or that most people are introduced to this concept in high school, and my brain cried out (silently, of course), This does not seem trivial at all and some of us did not have rigorous high school math educations!! Which began to degrade into ... I cant math. So I doodled.  (Inspired by a mixture of one of my favorite Calvin and Hobbes panels, currently adapted as my desktop background, the song Yakko's Universe from Animaniacs, and Pokemon for nostalgia) After finishing this weeks psets, I took a mental break from school and scribbled down a list of things to remember. Things that, in an ideal world, we should always remember, but especially when youre feeling a bit insignificant. (Even dust-speck-in-the-grand-scheme-of-time-and-space-type insignificant, as hard to avoid as it is.) 1) Stop. Collaborate and Listen. (Ice is back with my brand new invention) 90s song references aside... Be part of something greater than yourself, whether thats volunteering with an elementary school or playing on a club sports team or contributing to an online forum or writing those thank-you cards youve been meaning to for a couple of months. Some of my favorite organized internet projects that immediately come to mind: 2) Surround Yourself with Inspiration Much like Anna wrote, the walls of my room and B-Entry in MacGregor have many nice things. I plastered my one brick wall with posters of video games, TV shows, and comics that make me happy. (Props to you if you get all the references. A couple of them are pretty obscure.)  In the main lounge, my friend Lauren W. 16 and I painted a mural of B-Entrys crest (designed by B-entry upperclassmen and alums, and tweaked by us with the final rendering). Translation of the motto: All must be eaten.  And we also have a couple hundred pictures of B-Entry residents through the ages. We try and take photos pretty oftenwhen we go out to eat as a group, during birthdays, if someone falls asleep in the lounge. All your typical Kodak moments.    3) Talk to People! Perhaps the most cliched advice, but things are only cliche because theyre time tested and true, right? But actually. Friends and family are the best resources you have; theyre there to poke fun at you, talk sense into you, and make sure you maintain a certain level of sanity. To be that voice of reason saying:  4) Sometimes, Step Away from Obligations Its okay to take breaks! Wander around along hiking trails, read on a park bench, have a spontaneous picnic with friends. Go and immerse yourself in fictional worlds because oftentimes their dilemmas can help you resolve your own worries, or at the very least distract you for a little while. And, sometimes, a distraction is all you need to rediscover a sense of productivity. My current media recommendation: Welcome to Night Vale, a podcast staged as a radio broadcast for a fictional desert town. Its residents barely bat an eyelash at the appearance of sentient glowing clouds, the news cleverly satirizes many a public policy, and the weather is always a song from a different indie band. Basically, its clever and Lovecraftian and perfect to listen to while walking to class or waking up in the morning. On September 11, 2001, I had just begun my junior year. I was running late for my work-study bookbinding job, but managed to get there a little after 9. My "hi" to my coworkers died on my lips as I looked at their faces, drained of their usual cheer, widened by shock. "A plane crashed into the World Trade Center," Brian quietly informed me. Only then did I realize that the news was playing on the radio. We pulled up a news site on the office computer and watched the replay of the crash. I started to feel sick, and a need to be normal somehow. I pulled out my supplies and started working as we listened to the news, now live-streaming from the blue iMac in the center of the room. We watched as a second plane flew into the second tower. The most personal part of the day for me was what we heard next. "We're now receiving reports of an explosion at the Pentagon." My hand stilled over the book I was repairing as the words registered. An image of walking through the Pentagon smiling up at my dad as we walked to his office flashed through my brain. "My dad is there." A third plane crash was confirmed at the Pentagon, and my coworkers and I watched as the towers fell on screen. For some reason, this jolted me into action, and I left the office to find cell reception to call my dad. Nothing. I called my stepmother repeatedly, and I reached her on the third try. "Where's dad?" "He went in to work this morning. I haven't been able to reach him either." We hung up so she could keep trying. That was the only connection I made with her until late that night. When I returned, my coworkers looked at me expectantly, but I shook my head. Eric, my boss, told me I could go home. And wait alone? I discarded the idea for the methodical work before me. Cut, glue, press, sew, listen. We heard about Flight 93. I was pretty catatonic the rest of the day, sitting quietly and listening to the loop of news. At some point, I remember hearing that it was so hard to reach my stepmom because everyone was trying to reach someone. I remember hearing about the west side collapsing, and realizing it was almost opposite my dad's area. My phone finally rang. "Tasha?" "Dad! Are you okay?" "I'm fine. I walked out to my car to get something. When I turned around to return to the building, I saw the plane hit." I don't remember the rest of the conversation. But I remember today for the people who didn't get to have a phone call like mine, or had a phone call cut off because their loved one died shortly after talking to them. My heart goes out to you.  You: Where are you from?Me: London.You: But you...you don't...you don't seem to have a British accent.Me: Correct. Let me explain!

There are around 27 +/- 3 beds (too sleepy to think harder about it); two are doubles, and the rest are singles. We have nice things on our walls. This is something I tacked up outside my room:  And since then, people have been adding their own bubble wrap to it. This is on a wall in the same part of the house (called the Bermuda Triangle, because people get stuck there talking and can never leave):  More of the smiley tabs are gone, now (I took this picture a few days ago.) Around the house, we have little information sheets that Kelly '15 made for CPW and orientation -- that we left up, because we like them.   At the beginning of the year, we decorate the freshman doors. I painted a sign for my sister (yes, it looks like a kindergartener painted it. Get over it.) and her FPOP counselors made her a sign too.   Our residents travel all over the world, and send postcards and letters back to their MIT family. We tack them up on the wall in the kitchen.     There are nice things on the walls of my room, too.  I bought these in Santa Fe, New Mexico, the summer after I graduated from High School.  The next few are rather revealing of my interests.      And no walls would be complete without some pictures and memorabilia from home.   Hi blogosphere! I've wracked my brain wondering how to introduce myself to you. The ghosts of Uncle Labs and Beatriz have haunted me all weekend. I cannot hope to match their wit and experiences, but I am SO EXCITED to be talking to you "officially". I've been unofficially answering your questions for the last 9 months as MITAdmin, but I am grateful to now be both the most newbie admissions counselor/blogger and the new Bea. In my bio, I mentioned that MIT wasn't on my radar when I was applying to colleges. Obviously, if you're reading this blog, MIT is on your radar (or I've created the perfect search terms to draw you here or one of your MIT-loving friends shared this with you...*hint, hint* MIT-lovers). Since I've become a member of the MIT community, I've found the traditional nerdy pockets I love as well as some really cool programs/clubs/aspects of MIT that I don't think many people know about and should. So, here's my list: 1. Humanities matter. I'm expounding on this point from my bio as well. I used to think that if you wanted to have a variety of Humanities classes, that you would want to stay far away from MIT. But, the powers that be believed that engineers and scientists need to communicate their ideas well to people outside of their fields and instituted a Humanities requirement, in which you could take courses about social issues (Science of Race and Gender), writing, musical theater, or even if you're all math or science, the history of your scientific subject or how science currently affects policy in Washington. You may know that Junot Diaz teaches creative writing here, but you could also be taking classes with Ta-Nehisi Coates from The Atlantic, here on an MLK Fellowship. 2. Dedicated athletic/non-academic time. When I was an undergrad, I wanted to continue playing soccer, but couldn't because of my class schedule. MIT has a reserved block of time for athletics, gym classes, and other non-academic activities. I was reading in The Tech that the club sports had an amazing year and are another option if you want to be active. 3. Assassin's guild. While I have yet to see them in action, their poster in the Infinite Corridor has intrigued me for years. It sounds like an awesome way to destress after p-sets. There are over 450 clubs to join that are sure to make MIT a little more like home, and if there isn't, you can start a new club with four other people. 4. Size. I grew up in a town of about 2,000 people and the idea of going to a large school where no one knew me or my business was a little intimidating. Each dorm is its own community, but you also have a tight and supportive community of 4384 undergrad peers, which is the perfect mix of "You truly know me!" and "I recognize your face because we have the same class schedule and are late crossing Kresge oval together." 5. Boston and Cambridge. I love the small city atmosphere where you have lots of options for things to do if you choose to leave campus, but there's enough green that you can escape into the quiet or adventure in the great outdoors. My favorite place is near the Boston Women's Memorial on Comm Ave. Maybe I'll see you there!    I was fifteen and intensely naive when I graduated from high school and took a gap year. The story of how I decided to take a gap year is probably best saved for another blog post; the important thing is that I did. What can you gain from an entire year free from the bondage of school? Well, the obvious things...twelve months without school is fun, right? Eternal freedom. No homework. Staying up past midnight every night. The dream life. Well, no! No! Its not fine at all! The first few weeks of this unusual freedom were rife with extravagant eating, curling up in front of my ancient laptop narrowing down my list of unwatched movies and prodding my siblings ever-so-often to end their summer vacation and return to school already. Of course, they eventually did, and for a long time, I was alone. Its hard to value companionship until youre starved of it, and my stomach folded into thin layers after most of my high school friends vanished to college, taking on new spheres of life. I grew to resent staying at home, doing nothing, being nothing. Eternal nothingness. I did find a few ways to pass time. I wrote. I wrote a lot. I taught occasionally at my high school, which was a walking distance from where I lived. I tried old math olympiad problems that would have otherwise remained forgotten in dingy, cobwebbed boxes and heard them sigh with relief at renewed importance. I also had a slew of random adventures. I fell into a gutter one evening, scraping my knees and hands. I traveled to Ghana with my family during Christmas. We got to stay near a beach, and watched the waves pound on rocks all day. My cooking skills diversified somewhat, extending from cooking cereal and tea to cooking rice. And somehow,  I decided to apply to MIT.  I read my acceptance letter on March 14 at 11:30PM. I was alone in my room, listening to the air-conditioner buzz, my body temporarily robbed of air. I watched the decisions page load before me, my heart thumping, my mind screeching out a jumble of half-hopeful rants and justifications to explain every possible scenario that could play out. Seconds later, words poured out onto the screen. My brain exploded for a moment, and my mouth let out a shriek that burst eardrums and sent my parents hurtling into the room. A month later, I was in the United States for the first time, breathing in the awe of CPW. The sound of happy prefroshes, the view of a majestic dome that sprawled into the sky, the hug from an excited host who repeatedly yelled, This is awesome!, the understanding that in every direction I looked stood people with amazing abilities and deeply diverse passions. The Campus Preview Weekend for Admitted Students was an explosive summary of the diversity, passionate energy and power brewing through the very air pockets of MIT, and I was able to breathe it in, atmospheric gases of power I could contemplate, be overwhelmed by, but not fully get used to. Eventually, I made the decision to attend MIThow could I not?, my mind yelledand began the tortuous visa process with the image of the Institute keeping my morale up. As my gap year drew closer to its end, my level of excitement at the prospect of MIT grew. I felt I was readier for college than I might have been upon graduation months ago. I had a greater appreciation for the value of time and had gained new experiences (examples: a growth from no-cooking-skills to hazardous-but-fairly-acceptable-cooking skills, greater time spent with and more appreciation for my family, a chance to work on a huge writing project that eventually became a published novel). Time seems all too much until it is suddenly not enough, and I realized this the hard way. I distinctly remember the metamorphosis of emotions I got as Orientation drew closer. There was the exhilaration after I got my Student Visa, an understanding that MIT was really not a myth, that I was really going there! Growing nervousness as I realized that yes, yes, I was really going there, this place with those incredible people. A nervousness that became masked, internal terror, a skulking feeling of homesickness and great reluctance to change. But time moved on rudely anyway, paying my feelings no attention. I gave my wonderful family members final, long-lasting hugs and took a flight from Nigeria to the US, with a somewhat annoying tag around my neck that declared Unaccompanied Minor. On the plane, I watched an Indian Movie, smiling through it, and once the movie images relapsed into silence, I realized I was in a machine that was roaring above the ocean, pushing me further and further away from my family. I pushed my head against my seat and cried for a little while. I was a lot better after that. Feelings should never be bottled in. Seven action movies and an annoying 4-hour layover later, I was in Virginia where my uncle and his family lived. I spent a week with them, and they made sure it was as fun as possible. We went to an amusement park where I bravely risked death on several rides that stretched to the sky. Below is a picture of me (without my glasses for safety reasons) on one of the roller coasters. As you can see, Im the poster boy for unfazed, unflinching bravery. The girl next to me is my cousin though, and shes one heck of a screamer.  The week I spent with my uncle and his family brimmed with energy. We went shopping endless times. We hung out in a park one nice day for a picnic, during which I got mercilessly attacked by a bunch of merry kids wielding dangerous-looking water guns. We went to different restaurants, where I tried out new food, from shrimp to broccoli to lasagna to some weird meat-like lump I repeatedly poked with my fork before deciding it wasn't breathing. It was an awesome time, and the atmosphere of glee felt strong enough to last the rest of the week. I thought it would. If only life weren't so snide. On the day I was meant to return to MIT, on the day my excitement was supposed to reach some kind of crescendo, the happy atmosphere turned sour. Things took a turn for the worse. Quickly. Very quickly. You: Where are you from?Me: London.You: But you...you don't...you don't seem to have a British accent.Me: Correct. Let me explain!

Finishing it now. Pretend you are reading this on Saturday August 31.  - I'm sitting in 4-237 (a classroom with nice tiered seating and projectors) with ~40 freshmen and ~10 ESP admins. It's Firestorm: ESP admins teach 5-minute-long classes on ANYTHING THEY WANT! Categories and classes tonight: ABCDF....I? How to use MIT's grading system in dire situations You may be wondering how, with all students being varying shades of brilliant, MIT handles grades. On a 0%  100% scale? Maybe A for effort! A smiley sticker chart? Or is it a Downward Logarithmic Spiral of Doom? Never fear! Its similar to what a lot of us used in high school, namely, the ABCDF system, except with a few additions. Below is a screenshot of how your MIT grade report looks like online. Note: Your grade report is slightly different from your transcript. The grade report is for internal advising use only, and may have +/- modifiers, dropped/listener subjects, academic warnings that do not show up in the transcript you send externally.   (Here is a list of all the letters/symbols that may appear on an internal grade report.) You'll notice the usage of STP freshman fall. Rather than standing for Standard Temperature and Pressure, S refers to transfer credits, T is a temporary placeholder for a class still in transit, and P means pass. These do not weigh into your GPA. Spring semester was a little bit different. Unless you gain 'sophomore standing', there is a credit limit of 57 units. I used that opportunity to explore Course 1 in a Pass/Fail 9-unit Civil and Environmental Engineering Lab. 9 units is an overestimate of the time commitment of this class, which had a weekly 1 hour lecture and a 2 hour lab, basic readings and homework, and really awesome field trips to places like a wind turbine blade testing facility, Cape Cod, and even the ever-exotic Charles River. Although interesting, this class helped me realize that Course 1 wasn't my destiny.  SO WHAT IS THE BOXED I/A-? Short Answer An Incomplete grade is an option in certain situations where a student was unable to complete a course by the end of the semester. An I is stamped onto the report, and the student is given the opportunity to turn in late work by an assigned date. Upon completion of the course, the grade changes to I/X, where X is the official grade which weighs into your GPA. Long Answer with Backstory D-Lab is one of MIT's most amazing ways to get involved with international development. Last semester was the first time that D-Lab: Education was being offered, and I signed up right away, having been interested in educational reform since high school. It was my first project-oriented class, and I was really excited. Little did I know the depth I was getting into. Me and my teammate, Beibei (Wellesely '16), were introduced to our partners: The more we learned about each partner, the closer and more understanding our project became. We started the design process with introductions, a lot of questioning, and very thorough needs finding for the Avani school. Meanwhile, we were learning from and teaching lessons to our local classroom.  I was visiting the Advent classroom every Tuesday and becoming really close to the students, whether I was teaching about global geology through soil painting, or letting them design and build foreign architectures from recycled materials. Simultaneously, through many emails and Skype sessions, I was starting to understand the Avani community and its needs. We began the prototyping process for our project.  Everything was going really well... except for time. Since this was the first time this course was taught, the instructors were open to its direction and very facilitative with deadlines and expectations. Although our project was complete and we had presented it at the MIT Museum along with all other D-Lab classes, there was a deadline for the Final Project Report and separate Final Reflection which was already pushed for us to be right before finals. You can imagine that this can be a stressful time. My partner had started to help with the report, but the Wellesley term finished and she had to fly to China. When I realized the high quality (polished.pdf) and length (30 pages?!) of the other reports turned in, it was much more than I could produce, alone, in the hours I had. I discussed the situation with my instructors and was faced with the choice of either trying to do it all (these two reports alone were about 25% of my entire grade) and get a final grade based on that, or choose to get an Incomplete and submit everything within two weeks (but after finals). I had put a lot of time and effort into D-Lab throughout the semester and wanted to put my all into the remaining portion. I chose the latter option. Had I not, I would have been disappointed in the final outcome of something that had grown quite important to me. And so my summer break began with nonstop-motivated-work. After a few days I had written the most outstanding* papers I'd ever accomplished. *in both senses: very great and very late For me, an incomplete grade was a blessing. What is an incomplete grade? Sometimes, it's an opportunity to do your very best. MIT is a lot like a bowl of milk. A really really big bowl of milk. The students, accordingly, are a lot like tiny kittens (or any milk-loving entity of your choice). How big is this bowl of milk exactly? Well, I dont know. Stop trying to pick apart my metaphor before its gotten anywhere. The truth is, like perhaps many of the 1,116 freshmen in the class of 2017, right now, Im feeling a little overwhelmed. Before me lies a seemingly endless expanse of liquid lactose and my milk-loving self is struggling to take it all in. Dont get me wrong. I love it here already. Sure, the psets are already rolling in, the reading is piling up, and the grand total of my high school knowledge is quickly being surpassed. But when I say overwhelmed, I dont mean stressed out or crushed. I certainly dont feel anything like the Roman troops did when they were overwhelmed by the barbarians (thank you Dictionary.com for your invaluable sample sentences). Maybe overwhelmed isnt even the word Im looking for here. Is there a word for being utterly thrilled, pleasantly surprised, happily exhausted, exorbitantly eager, and possibly a little bit nervous all at the same time? Probably not. But there should be. Because how else is one supposed to describe the experience of plunging headfirst into MIT? Oh yeah. GIFs.  I'm new here and maybe I just haven't properly learned how to drink from the milk bowl of MIT. I'm guessing this skill comes later on. You don't really see too many old, one eyed cats flailing around in bowls of milk. One day I too shall be an old, one eyed cat who has learned the art of maintaining a balanced and fulfilled life in college. I arrived on campus for FUP (the Freshman Urban Program aka the best FPOP out there) and since then, I have been careening through two and a half weeks of volunteer work, friendly introductions, REX events, orientation meetings, scheduling dilemmas, and, most recently, the infamous classes. At the activities midway, a two hour event in which many of MIT's over 300 student groups and organizations set up booths in the Z center ice rink, I found myself surrounded by enthusiastic students spreading the word about their favorite activities while passing out free food and objects of questionable utility (i.e. a rubber duck). So many groups, so little time. I ended up putting my name down for more clubs than I could possibly join and I expect my inbox to be flooded with information session invitations and emails about introductory events. People are always saying that college is a time for reinventing yourself, so why not start by trying something new? While I cant yet say whether or not this shotgun method of expanding my horizons is effective, I can say that it's best to keep an open mind when it comes to stepping outside of your comfort zone. Who knows, maybe my one true calling is mastering the art of chocolate, or discovering the finer points of poutine and hockey.* *real, awesome clubs listed on the Association of Student Activities website Unfortunately, I wont be able to do justice to all of the crazy things that have happened to me in these two and a half weeks in just one measly blog post. Even just my adventures through freshmen registration, the course listings and the sometimes confusing GIRs (General Institute Requirements) could fill a couple pages. Lets just say I finally settled on my fall semester schedule after quite a few trips to the advising offices, a handful of emails, and hours spent culling information from helpful upperclassmen and discerning the difference between courses starting with the numbers 3, 12, 24, and 7 etc. (1732 points for already knowing the difference. Points can be redeemed for a choice of: absolutely nothing or a healthy dose of self-satisfaction) While being a freshman can certainly be overwhelming, there are always people here at MIT who are willing to lend a hand. And now, for your viewing pleasure, my schedule: Some people compare the MIT experience to drinking out of a fire hose. To me, that experience sounds far too violent and uncomfortable. From my experience, albeit a limited one, Id much rather imagine MIT as a giant bowl of milk in which thousands of motivated undergraduate and graduate kittens can frolic in and drink from. As we return to the original metaphor, I might be covered in milk now and out of breath from my milk bowl acrobatics, but Im enjoying every second of it. Im sure some jaded upperclassman is reading this and laughing at my wide-eyed enthusiasm. Silly freshman, just wait until you learn the true meaning of IHTFP, they mumble under their coffee-tinged breath. But until then, I wont cry over all the milk Ive spilled in the process or the countless times that I will inevitably slip. I cant physically try everything that MIT has to offer and I understand that. As my fellow freshmen and I prepare for week two of classes, there is only one thing left to say. Moar milk plz. After talking to my friends during the first week of senior year and getting cold glares cast my way each time I shared my schedule, I've realized I may be one of the few people who regularly has days off. This was totally a deliberate choice. How does that end up happening? If you're lucky, all the classes that you want to take might fall on the same two or three days. And, if you're sly (or legitimately busy, but nobody can tell the difference if you don't let others on to your reasoning), you can also block off certain hours in your schedule during preregistration to get placed into the recitation sections you want! No matter how you achieve it, the result is the same: a couple of 24 hour periods each week wherein you now need to find something else to do besides psets. For example, on Thursday, my first day off, I was faced with the conundrum -- or privilege? -- of having too much free time. My running shorts and running shoes looked a little lonely and abandoned that morning, so I went back to interval training for the first time in maybe a year or so. Now might be a good time to mention that if you get into running, it really, really sucks to stop, become almost sedentary, and then get back into it after a long time. At least, that's how it was for me in the act of running. Once I was done, though, I had a lot of residual energy to do...well, nothing but work through my Steam library backlog. In fairness, my p-sets weren't posted until today, so it's not like I could be super productive or anything. But back to classes. This semester, I'm taking a 12-unit UROP and three 12-unit classes, where each unit roughly corresponds to a suggested hour spent on the class a week. I want to talk more about my recent UROP adventures in a separate post, since there's a ton of things that I've done/learned and ways that I've grown, but suffice it to say that I'm now beginning to explore some imaging analysis after a cool project from this summer. That imaging project also just started, so there's not too much that I can say right now, but there will be more to come! The non-UROP part of my schedule looks a little something like this: But of course, the real proof in the pudding is in the eating...only here, the pudding is classes, and the eating is doing p-sets. We'll see how these choices of mine hold up over the semester. "Okay, everybody! Shut up!" Aaron*, dance coach of the MIT Ballroom Dance Team, stared out at the crowd of giggling students attempting, in pairs, to stumble out the steps of the international rumba. Here in Lobby 13, the dancers-to-be had convened from near and far, hailing from MIT, Wellesley, Harvard, and beyond for the Ballroom Dance Camp, Day 2. "Look, enthusiasm is good," said Aaron. "But you need to find internal enthusiasm. Your enthusiasm comes from outside, so it is only momentary. Internal enthusiasm stays with you forever. To dance, you must find a balance within yourself." He had quite a point. Calling MIT freshmen "enthusiastic" was probably an understatement. We've been positively explosive for the past two weeks, and even though classes just started this Wednesday, there are no signs of anyone settling down. The buzz of newness still fills the air as we roam MIT and Boston, losing sleep and loading up on free food, free t-shirts, free bags, free water bottles, free alarm clocks, and even...free levels, courtesy MIT Libraries. Every engineer's gotta know where his level is, right? Mine is now on top of my roommate's whiteboard, where it affirms that the whiteboard is indeed level (an accomplishment my roommate and I are fairly proud of, having mounted the whiteboard before we had access to a level).  Which brings us back to balance. "I know you are having fun, but your dancing will always express what you are inside," continued Aaron. "Stop talking. Focus. Feel the music. Feel the dance within you. That's how you have real fun. You. Must. Find. Balance." Balance, is of course, difficult to find at a place at MIT. There's just so much going on outside of classes and ballroom dancing. For example, slacklining between two trees outside the student center:  My introduction to slacklining went something like this: Me: "Whoa, this is really cool! I'm gonna watch!" Slackliner: "Hey, do you wanna try? Kick off your shoes and hop on!" If there's one thing about MIT I love so far, it's that exchanges like this are totally common. Everyone takes immense pleasure in sharing their passions and hobbies, even with total strangers.In any case, slacklining is not tightrope walking (because the line is, you know, slack). The line is a one-inch-wide nylon or polyester webbing that wobbles like crazy. It's essentially a one-inch-wide trampoline. The trick to slacklining, so I gather, lies in training your leg to counter-wobble against the line's wobbling. If you counter-wobble too slowly, you'll actually amplify the wobbling by resonating with it and probably fall off the line. I've been slacklining a total of three times now (the slackliner is super friendly and invites all of his new "apprentices," who are mainly interested noobs like me, every time he sets up the line), and I can now almost make it halfway across the line without having my hand on someone's shoulder. The secret? Finding balance. Sometimes you feel like you'll fall off, and you have to throw out an arm or a leg to counterbalance and keep your center of mass above the line. Most of the time you still fall off the line, and you learn quickly to take it in stride, get back on and try again. And again. And again. You've probably guessed where this metaphor is going. Finding balance in slacklining is, in this sense, a lot like finding balance in dance, and both slacklining and dance are (I suspect) a lot like life at MIT. It will be fun, and also equally frustrating. It will take focus and careful teamwork. I will probably fail often, and that probably won't stop me from continuing to try. And hopefully, I'll get better at finding balance day by day.

You're thinking, "hey, you missed an apostrophe!"  You're also thinking, "what does a second-year know about being a mechanical engineer anyway?"* *you're probably not thinking this, but hey it's my blog and I get to put words in your mouth if I want. That's a good question, which is why I went trekking to Professor Warren Seering (my new advisor)'s office on Tuesday in search for the answers to life, the universe, and also how to navigate the Course 2 roadmap, littered with numbers like 2.671, 2.ThU, 2.009, and 2.087 (which can be replaced by 18.03, if you were wondering). And after chatting with Professor Seering for 15 minutes or so, I was convinced that he not only is the Best Advisor In the Universe but also might possibly be a magician, because: Incidentally, he also kinda looks like Ben Affleck in Argo:  Which obviously means that Professor Seering is the Batman.   You see, the reason my schedule was a bit tricky is that I'm applying to the Course 2 Cambridge-MIT Exchange (CME) one semester program, which would take place junior spring.  This means that I must take 2.005 and 2.006 and also some other stuff by junior fall, so the standard Course 2 roadmap doesn't work out at all for me.  But in the end, with help and advice from Kirsten L '15 and Professor Seering and Brandy Baker (the MechE course administrator), I got things worked out. Anyway, without further ado (who am I kidding here, my blog is basically 30% ado anyway), the classes I'm taking this year! I'm pretty psyched about all my classes - no more GIRs this year!  2.001 and 2.003 are standard Course 2 requirements.  2.086 is now a strict prerequisite for 2.005 (remember I have to take that next semester if I'm aiming to do CME), which is why that's in my schedule. I'm particularly excited about 2.678 and CMS.350 - the former because it's basically a lab class dedicated to teaching and helping you build whatever electronics projects you want, and the latter because it's taught by Seth Mnookin, who I am totally a secret fanboy of (Hard News and The Panic Virus are fantastic reads).  He also moderated last year's Nate Silver event and has a gazillion followers on Twitter, so I'm hoping to pick up some of his secrets.  According to the course description, CMS.350 will evaluate modern day journalism ranging from the New York Times to Twitter feeds, and assignments will be submitted through an online portal which mimics an online news source.  As you may know, I was reaaaaaally active in journalism in high school but haven't really had time at MIT to join the Tech.  So this class seems like a perfect fit, and I look forward to analyzing Snow Fall or whatever other gorgeous media extravaganzas the Times has come up with by the end of 2013.

I want to take every class eventually and I can't decide!" So, here's a post with my course history. It's a nice record of my transition from pre-med/brains to astronomy. More details about this semester's line-up to come; I would write a more detailed thing now, but it's 12:07am and I was supposed to be in bed 7 minutes ago. Please feel free to post any questions about this! You can also look up each of these classes by typing the subject number into the Course Catalog.  Summary: I will graduate with a major in physics and a concentration in literature, having taken classes in 12 out of these 35 departments. 1/3: not bad.  FRESHMAN YEAR Fall Congratulations to the incoming Class of 2018!  Each and every one of you is incredible, and I am so excited to see your happy faces light up the institute once again in the fall!   So now you've decided to go to MIT, but you haven't paid a dime or picked a class yet. The biggest thing on your plate right now is figuring out when to take the Freshman Essay Evaluation (FEE) or which pre-orientation program to take. Meanwhile, all your other friends are picking out their schedule for the fall. Some of them already know where they are living, and maybe they even entered a randomized lottery to get placed in their basic required classes that everyone else is getting placed in.  MIT is different from other schools. I want to lay out some basics about what you might want or need to know about your freshmen year.  I've learned a lot through my own experiences from my first year at MIT, as well as through being an associate advisor my sophomore year.  Here is my advice! And also some descriptions of what will be required of you as a frosh. Do a Freshman Pre-Orientation Program (FPOP) The applications are due June 15th! SIGN UP FOR AN FPOP!! There is an awesome Mark Twain quote on the FPOP website: "Twenty Years from now you will be more disappointed by the things you didn't do than by the ones you did. So throw off the bowlines. Sail away from the safe harbor. Catch the trade winds in your sails. Explore. Dream."                                       - Mark Twain (1835-1910) I think Mark Twain and MIT admissions painted the right picture for you - FPOPs are a great opportunity for you to do things outside of your comfort zone, and it also is the perfect way for you to start making friends that will last you your four years at MIT and beyond.  The FPOPs range from aerospace to computer science to energy to leadership to exercise to literature to product design and SO MUCH MORE! This year there are twenty-two FPOPs offered in August, and each one gives an amazing introduction to MIT and the beautiful city that surrounds us. My experience includes doing the Freshman Urban Planning FPOP as a frosh, and working as a mentor for the Discover Materials Science & Engineering FPOP.  Each one introduced me to MIT, Cambridge, Boston, and a new group of awesome friends, and I am so grateful for the opportunities! Preservation of the Frosh  Just a few logistics - you are a prefrosh right now, and the 2017s are frosh.  You will not be a frosh and the frosh will not be sophomores until President Reif goes on a giant stage and welcomes you, the Class of 2018, as the freshman class.  President Hockfield never welcomed the Class of 2015 because of bad weather. They are still freshman. This makes sense. The reason why this is how it is and the way it has always be done is because we want to have prefrosh for as long as possible, and there must always be a freshman class, and while sophomores become juniors and juniors become seniors and seniors become crufty, sophomores don't need to be conserved. Only you, the prefrosh or frosh of MIT, must be conserved. Take HASS Classes! Now into some academics - I'll briefly explain the HASS system here at MIT. You are required to take eight HASS - humanities, arts, and social sciences - classes during your time here at MIT.  Of those eight classes, you must take at least one humanities, one arts, and one social sciences class. You must also fulfill a HASS concentration, which involves taking 3-4 classes in a certain subject. For example, I plan on concentrating in writing poetry, which involves me taking a few poetry workshop classes and a reading poetry class. TAKE A HASS CLASS YOUR FIRST SEMESTER! Take at least one HASS class EACH semester!!  I have made this mistake twice and I cannot emphasize it enough.  Taking four (or five) technical classes is extremely difficult, and might drive you insane.  I understand that you might want to take all your required GIRs first semester since you are on Pass/No Record and don't want to have to worry about getting a good grade in these really difficult classes.  But this leads me to my next point... Pass/No Record is NOT an excuse to get a C- in every class You will hear "A=B=C=P," and it might be true when it comes down to a transcript, but it is not true when it comes to challenging yourself and figuring out what it takes to get an A in a class at MIT.  Aim high and try the hardest you can in your classes - the semester will be over more quickly than you know, and you will have to take graded classes based on the information you learned in your Pass/No Record classes.  If you didn't learn any information, then you really are going to be sad in the following semesters.  Use Pass/No Record to your advantage by seeing how much you can handle on your plate in addition to your classes.  Join a club sport or class council or rush a fraternity (and steal all their food and then come to East Campus)  and use this time to become close with the people around you.  Watch how you can allocate your time to still do well in your classes while being involved on campus, and make sure that you are not overcommitting to too much.  Pass/No Record is not an excuse to not try in your classes, but it is an excuse to go outside your comfort zone to figure out what it takes to live a balanced life at MIT.  People say "Social Life, Classes, Sleep - pick two." But you can have all three, even at a place with incredibly difficult and time-consuming classes like MIT. Classes to take your Freshman Year So you have to take a HASS class and you have to do your best in your classes - but what should those classes be?  I'm going to highlight the technical class options you have for your freshman year. All MIT students must complete a total of 17 General Institute Requirements, or GIRs.  It is possible to get out of some of these GIRs through AP credit or through passing an Advanced Standing Exam (ASE), which is basically like taking the final of the class right at the bat of the semester.  At any other time, the grade you get on an ASE would show up on your transcript. As a freshman on Pass/No Record, if you pass the ASE, you get a P! They have extended the offered biology classes from my year to include four different types of introductory classes that fulfill the biology requirement: 7.012, 7.013, 7014, and 7.016.  In the fall, you can take either 7.012 or 7.016. 7.013 and 7.014 are offered in the spring.  All of these classes cover the same fundamental principles of biochemistry, genetics, molecular and cell biology.  However, they each focus on a different one of these.   I recommend taking biology in the fall if you feel confident in your chemistry abilities, and in the spring if you do not.  I took biology at the same time as my chemistry class, and it did feel quite overwhelming at times.  Definitely try to split them apart so you can focus on them individually. Here at MIT, you are required to take single-variable (18.01) and multi-variable (18.02) calculus.  There are different versions of each that you can take, and my advice is to take the slightly harder version of whatever you feel comfortable with, that way you can drop down to a different version of the class if you decide that it is too difficult.  I would also recommend doing whichever track allows you to take 18.03, or differential equations, in the spring, although this might not be feasible for people who want to take 18.014 and 18.024, which are advanced classes that focus on calculus with theory.  18.03 is not a GIR (contrary to popular belief), but many, if not most, majors have it as a requirement.  It also is an extremely difficult and important class, and it is very necessary to have a strong math background before taking it. So if you ASE or AP out of 18.01, congratulations! Take 18.02 or 18.014. If you do not ASE or AP out of 18.01, taking 18.01 is fine, but consider taking 18.01A/18.02A.  This class involves a six-week review of single-variable claculus, and then 18.02 taken at the regular pace, which continues into IAP (Independent Activities Period during January).  Besides, if you start out taking 18.01A, it is perfectly fine and acceptable to drop down to 18.01 if it ends up being too difficult. Challenge yourself! Freshman year is all about discovering what your limits are - if 18.01A extends beyond your limits, that is okay! It does not mean you are any less smart than any of your peers or that you don't belong at MIT, it just means that maybe you weren't quite ready for that class. I am biased because I am course 3 (materials science and engineering), but TAKE 3.091!! Okay now I am going to be honest - you will have the option to take one of the following: 5.111, 5.112, or 3.091.  5.111 (pronounced five-eleven-one) is basic chemistry, with slightly more focus on liquid-state materials.  5.112 (pronounced five-eleven-two) is a bit more advanced version of 5.111, and covers additional materials that might help you if you plan on majoring in chemistry or becoming pre-med.  3.091 (pronounced three-oh-nine-one) focuses on solid-state materials, which I think are extremely interesting and I thought that the class was very well taught.  You might have heard rumors about 3.091 in the fall having no tests and, as a result, being quite disorganized and/or terrible.  However, this fall, 3.091 is going to be taught in the traditional way with tests (and hopefully no attendance grade) and small quizzes and the really great Professor Cima, and it will be an awesome class! Take it! Learn about phase diagrams and chocolate and materials! Yay materials! Yay polymers! The other day, I got a facebook message from the lovely Kimia Z. '18 asking about first semester physics, which is mechanics. She told me that her school has a very weak physics program, and she wanted to know if I would recommend she try to take classes over the summer. I told her that if you don't feel confident in your physics skills, I highly recommend taking 8.01L in the fall.  The class has the same content as 8.01, but it is taught over a longer period of time and in lecture style instead of in TEAL sessions, where you learn about a concept and immediately do a problem about it on whiteboards around the room in groups.  8.01L consists of the fall semester and IAP, and it was completely worth taking 8.01L for me and I felt a lot more confident about my physics skills moving at the slower pace than I would have in 8.01 TEAL. If you do feel uncomfortable with your physics background and want to take 8.01 anyway, that is perfectly fine, and again, you can always switch it to 8.01L later. And if you want to review concepts before classes start, MIT opencourseware is an amazing resource! The other requirement is 8.02, which is about electrical and magnetic properties in physics.  This is also taught in TEAL style, however, if you feel super confident in your physics abilities, you can choose to take 8.012 and 8.022 in the fall and spring respectively, which are advanced versions of each of the classes, taught in lecture style. Many of my friends on Tetazoo did this track, and they really enjoyed the classes and are now planning on double majoring in physics! Will L. '16 described the difference - "8.012 and 8.022 are good for showing what course 8 is like at MIT. 8.01 and 8.02 are more engineering classes." I mentioned the HASS requirement earlier, but in addition to taking 8 HASS classes, two of those classes must be communication intensive classes. Depending on if you get out of taking the FEE or if you pass it, you will either have to take a CI-H (communication intensive humanities class) or a CI-HW (communication intensive humanities writing class) your freshman year.  These classes involve writing a couple essays, writing a revision for one of those essays, and writing a big paper at the end. I don't like papers.  I took Bioethics (24.06) my freshman spring and it was okay. I'm doing anything I can to procrastinate taking another CI-H. Don't procrastinate!! The HASS classes are all listed on the internet with the other classes. That's all great... but when do I actually pick out my classes? In the fall! When you get here for your pre-orientation program, you are going to check into your temporary room in your temporary dorm, and you are going to spend many hours of many days at your FPOP having fun. After the final day of your FPOP, you will check in with your orientation leader.  (Quick note - Orientation activities are optional.)  This is the week that you will meet with your advisor and your associate advisor(s), and they will help you sort out your final schedule. It is nice to have some sort of plan on what you want to take, but that is not at all necessary.  You will very likely get the classes you want to take.  This leads me to my next point... Meet your Advising Team! Free food! Woo advising teams! I was an associate advisor this past year, and it was my duty, along with a faculty advisor, to help my advisees choose a path that was right for them. My advice to you is to keep in touch with your advising team - we are a great resource for you to reach out to in case of trouble with choosing classes or doing well in classes or life or anything else at all!  Come ask us questions! We will send you care packages and take you to get ice cream and more! As far as choosing freshman advising, there are two main options. You can choose advising that involves credit such as a learning community, or advising that offers no credit like traditional advising.  There is also residence based advising in some dorms, but, in my personal opinion, this system is a little unfair because it requires you to be stuck in your dorm for a full year, even if you decide that it is not the place for you.  Please keep this in mind when choosing which dorm you want to live in, because this can be a big commitment.  The dorms that have RBA are Maseeh, McCormick, Next House, Chocolate City, and Spanish House.  So if you know that these are the places that you want to live in forever and ever, go ahead! Put them as your first choice! But, be forewarned, if it turns out that the place isn't all you thought it was, you are stuck! (These are my opinions - there are many people who end up loving their dorm and the residence based advising programs!) I am a big fan of traditional advising, which just makes it so that your advisor is there for you when you need them, if you need them, and same with your associate advisor.  But all in all, your biggest source of information will be the upperclassmen on campus that you live with, work with, eat with, and are friends with. So come talk to us, we don't bite! And feel free to ask me questions anytime - comment below or come visit me during rush in East Campus! I'll dye your head a strange color! Or all the colors! Take Physical Education Classes EARLY. TAKE THE SWIM TEST! You just got here. It's day one of orientation, and you're signed up for the 12pm swim test.  But you're sleepy. You rather sleep. Sleep sleep sleep. GET UP! Go take the swim test! There are some people who wait until right before they graduate to take the swim test - don't do that! If you fail, you don't get to graduate from MIT. You have to wait another semester. Don't do that!!  If you don't feel comfortable swimming, that is okay! Take the swim physical education class right away! Don't save these required things for your senior year, because you only need to miss a few PE classes to fail one. Also, people will tell you that you need to complete the physical education requirement by your sophomore year. This is not true. Sometimes, you just cannot fit a PE class into your schedule - that is completely understandable. But try to spread out taking the classes, or at least a couple of the four required PE classes, during your freshman year while you have the time to do so.  And take the swim test! Do it!! Take advantage of REX! IT IS CPW ALL OVER AGAIN - BUT EVEN BETTER! Orientation - AKA Rush - is another time when we, the denizens of East Campus, as well as all other living groups around campus do everything in our/their power to convince you that our/their dorm is the best dorm and that you should live here/there!  I will post a lot of pictures in the fall of the awesome activities (including roller coaster building!) happening around East Campus, but do your best to visit every single dorm on campus, steal all the free food, and have a great time! Make new friends, build awesome things, eat great food, and have the time of your life before classes start and consume us all. I hope my little tidbits of advice are helpful!

And, of course, a... read more  see complete archives   Below is one of the robots I built for 2.007, MIT's extremely popular introductory design and manufacturing class:    For reference, here's the first "robot" I ever built, on the first day of 2.007:  Before I took 2.007, I hadn't ever used a mill or lathe.  I wasn't sure what it meant to tap a hole. Heck, I'd never used a power drill before.  But four months later, I was comfortable with all of these tools, thanks in large part to the awesome shop guys (particularly Bill and Tasker). I built my first gearbox and learned how to use fast fabrication methods.  And I built a pair of robots that actually did quite well in the competition!  It's been a lot of fun.  Here's a rough summary of the past few months: 2.007 is well known for its chaos and intensity, and it's intimidating to be told that by the end of this class you'll be building a Robot, capital 'R', and competing against your peers, many of whom have had years of FIRST robotics experience.  Suddenly you're faced with design decisions, big scary machine tools that you're not entirely comfortable turning on, part choices, and Arduinos, maybe even before you know what gears and bearings and linkages are. So what do you do?  Like any good engineer, break it up into smaller, more manageable pieces.  Our first assignment is to build a "Mini Me" robot that can drive around from a basic list of materials.  By the end of lab, I've bandsawed the glorified bent piece of plastic above and stuck 2 motors + an RC receiver on it.  It's not pretty, but it drives. At the end of lab, my (awesome) lab instructor Chip reminds us to always fasten our wheels, because loose wheels have tripped up many a top competitor before.  ~~~foreshadowing alert~~~ This year's robot competition is ski-themed - MITSKI! The instructors have build this cool course consisting of three different hills of different grades, with flags to pull, medals to collect, and trophies to pull.  Quickly it becomes apparent that the most efficient way to score points is to do laps on the extremely steep 60 degree top hill (in hindsight, I wish they had made flag pulling worth more points, as it would have led to more interesting robot mechanisms).  It's not a trivial problem to solve.  Because of the steepness of the hill, tipping is a problem.  Because of the slippery surface material, slipping is also a problem. As Richard Hammond from Top Gear tells us in a recorded video, "keep your centers of gravity low and your coefficients of friction high." For several days I iterate and iterate on a design (nicknamed "Spatula Bot") that tries to climb the steep hill by keeping my center of gravity extremely low.  It works, kind of; it's extremely slow up the slope, far too slow to have any hope of running multiple laps during the 120 second competition period.  Notice that I'm making extensive use of waterjetting sheet metal to make precise, elegant parts; thanks to my friend Emma S. '16 for her help waterjetting!  Amusingly, one of the robots on the final day is named "Flagrant Abuse of the Waterjet", a title that would have been accurate for my robots. Major credit goes to Josh B. '16, as he designs the first robot capable of quickly climbing the top hill, using a rail gripper.  His design ends up strongly influencing the rest of the field's hill climbers as well.  Here's a CAD of one of my early successful prototypes utilizing a "ski gripper", v2 of what eventually becomes my Ascensionist robot:  The RC controllers and Playstation controllers provided by 2.007 aren't terribly reliable or easy to use.  I decide early on to use my iPhone and iPad to control my robots via OSC, a wireless protocol usually used by DJs to connect to sound synthesizers.  This has the advantage of letting me avoid the bottleneck of waiting for available RC controllers later in the semester.  I briefly toy around with the idea of making a robot with large diameter wheels that drives equally well upside down, and build a few prototypes.  But the high speed motors I'm using don't have enough torque to drive the large wheels up the top hill, and I decide to revert to a strategy of building roll bars:  And this ends up being very similar to my final design; I also lower my entire chassis and use a 3D printed fixture to mount my motors.  Early on I discovered that tumbling down the top hill easily damages the delicate high speed motors I'm using.  My 3D printed mounts work well, and soon after lots of people are using them for their robots as well. As you can see from the propagation of Josh's rail gripper idea and my 3D printed motor mounts, ideas spread fast in 2.007.  That's the way it's designed: even though you're building your robot as an individual, especially for beginner builders it's essential to collaborate and work with other people.  Forget about "helping the competition"; working together and seeing what designs work (and just as important, which designs don't work) will save loads of time and lead to better robots for everyone. Plus, these are your peers, who you'll be working together with in 2.008, 2.009, and other team projects.  Don't burn your bridges by being petty and accusing people of "stealing" your general ideas.  This ain't Apple vs. Samsung. I've got my hill climbing robot mostly done, but I also want to build a robot that pulls down the multiplier.  But there's no way I'll be able to design, fabricate, and test an additional robot in 1 week.  Is there? One of the most underutilized resources in 2.007 (in my opinion) is a document called "How To Build Your Everything Really Really Fast".  It's written by Charles Guan, who now teaches the electric gokart special section of 2.007 (see, "it doesn't have to be a robot"), and goes into lots of fast fabrication techniques. Robust robot designs generally require a lot of right angles; with traditional fabrication techniques this can involve lots of milling and drilling precise holes.  But using waterjetting and fastener techniques like "t-nuts", you can save a lot of time and throw together fairly complicated robots quickly. A task that would have seemed impossible for me at the beginning of the semester, but thanks to Tasker and Steve (the shop guys in charge of the waterjet and lasercutter) I'm able to do it.  Here's the gearbox that eventually goes into the robot at the top of this page:  Note the extensive use of standoffs and t-nuts.  This makes my multiplier bot extremely modular; I'm able to completely disassemble and iterate my chassis and gearbox design in minutes, as opposed to hours.  Here's the final design of my 2 robots:  My hill climber robot scores enough points to seed me 2nd in the tournament (behind the aforementioned Josh), which means that I have a guaranteed spot on the final day of competition, and get to relax and watch the preliminaries. Then competition day comes, and it's totally awesome.  Besides the robots, there's this "Engineering Petting Zoo" showcasing cool machines from companies and students.  Among the stuff featured: Tony Stewart's NASCAR racecar, a Corvette, and electric gokarts built by the 2.007 alternate section. But the robots are the main attraction of the day, of course.  I'm able to cruise through the first few rounds of competition despite my hill climber flipping over, thanks to my multiplier bot.  Clockwise from top left: me controlling my hill climber via iPhone, Josh's hill climber + medal grabber bot, Danny (one of the lab instructors) and his Ski Patrol outfit, my multiplier bot in action.  Photo credits to Landon C. '17. But robustness is key, and one of my hill climber's wheels pops off in the final 8 round. I knew I should have listened to Chip and remembered to screw those wheels on.  An unfortunate time to learn that lesson, but I still have a lot of fun watching the final 4 duke it out. The final match, between Josh B. '16 and Clare Z. '16 proves to be especially exciting.  Josh's pair of autonomous robots has performed well all night and is capable of scoring well over 600 points - but Clare's manually controlled robot is crucially super robust and reliable.  In a huge upset, Josh's hill climber gets stuck in a rut, meaning his multiplier bot isn't able to push the trophy, and Clare wins with a score of 312.   Clare winning the gold trophy, next to Professor Sangbae Kim and Professor Amos Winter.  Photo credit to Landon C. '17. A thrilling end to the night, and a great way to cap off my favorite class at MIT so far.  I can't wait to take 2.008 and 2.009! Week 1: Spider-Man, Nina Yuen, and More! The concept is simple, users ask the question "What if x piece of history was different" and the more historically inclined Redditors construct an argument, with sources, about what would have happened. Here are a few of my favorite questions. "How would modern American football players fare in an ancient world?" "What if Afghanistan was never invaded by the United Front and the Taliban regime continued to conquer all of Afghanistan?" "What would allow the Roman Empire to last until today?"  A few months back I discovered the Geek And Sundry Youtube series of TableTop and I fell in love. Every week Wil Wheaton would gather a few of his celebrity friends and play a new Board/Card/Role-Playing game. The show was funny, the games were interesting, and it helped kindle a deep love of TableTop gaming. I burnt through all of the episodes in about a week or two and word on the street was that they were going to try to Crowdfund season 3. After a few weeks of doing just that, they've exceeded their goals and will be able to make 20 episodes and a Role-Playing Game show. I can't wait!   Net Neutrality is a topic that I've been closely following for a while now. The decision that the FCC makes will have a large impact on my future career and it's nice to see Youtubers spreading the word.  A few weeks back I started taking Complexity Theory and it has quickly risen through the ranks of my favorite classes this year. Every lecture has been better than the one before and the world of P vs. NP is slowly making sense. Apologies for breaking the Zaxxon rule with this one but it's been a while since a series of lectures was this interesting. Click HERE for a nice ELI10 of the problem.  After reading through The Name of the Wind/A Wise Man's Fear during Christmas break I started looking around for more fantasy books to fill my time and picked up The Blade Itself (Book 1 of The First Law trilogy). Whereas most of the books I loved before coming to MIT were Young Adult I decided to move to the more mature end of the spectrum. I've been reading The Blade Itself sporadically since December but it was becoming increasingly difficult to remember names or what's going on. So lately I've been waking up a little bit early to read every morning and I absolutely love the book.    And with that I'll finish asking you guys a simple question, what's making you happy this week? Trouble thinking up a good Kerberos username? Take some hints from Batman.                           Earlier this week, Morgan O. (G) invited MIT EMS and our campus police officers (who unfortunately could not attend) to see the place where she works - the roof of the Green Building!  The Green Building is the tallest building in Cambridge - 19 stories tall and on stilts at 277 feet!  She brought up her giant telescope and we looked at the moon, Mars, Jupiter and more! The view from the Green Building, the home of MIT's Earth and Planetary Scienes department, was absolutely gorgeous!  Lawrence W. (G) brought his really pretty camera and I brought mine, and we had some fun with them on the roof!   Adam S. '14 wanted a photo of him in front of the fanastic Boston skyline, and it wasn't long before everyone wanted their shot in front of the view!          In the end, we had a wonderful time, and we were all so glad that Morgan brought us up there to see Boston and Cambridge from a completely new perspective.  see complete archives  Today we're releasing our decisions regarding transfer applicants who applied for admission for Fall 2014. Transfer applicants, unlike freshman applicants, receive decisions via email from our office to the address listed on their application. The emails will be sent at 5 PM Eastern today, May 7, and you should receive it shortly thereafter, depending on the traffic in the tubes. Our transfer admissions process was quite competitive. As in past years, hundreds of students applied, and we only had space to admit fewer than 20 students. It is a difficult process: as usual, we are very excited about the students we have admitted, and often chagrined about those we could not. As a former transfer student myself, I know that this process can be a complicated one. For those of you who were admitted: welcome to MIT. For those who weren't: I wish you the best of luck. I transferred, but if I hadn't things would have been fine. Remember, college is mostly what you make of it, here or anywhere else; if you weren't one of those students whom we admitted, I wish you the best of luck wherever you go (or stay).  You: Where are you from?Me: London.You: But you...you don't...you don't seem to have a British accent.Me: Correct. Let me explain! I was born in Singapore, had a Singaporean accent, then moved to London during the summer before fifth... read more  see complete archives  Part 1 here. *     *     * Rush Holt is in the room, but most people havent noticed. To be fair, hes a name rather than a face for most of us: the PhD physicist-turned-politician, one of two physicists in Congress, now the US Representative for New Jerseys 12th congressional district. I happen to know what he looks like because an assistant addressed him by name when I passed by in the hallway.  Now, Im in a big room scarfing down bacon and coffee with over a hundred other representatives from science and engineering organizations, waiting for Rep. Holt to give a speech. And now that the Congressman is physically in the room, the internal conflict begins. I think, I will probably never have the chance to meet Rush Holt ever again. Then I think, I have nothing to say to Rush Holt, and he probably doesnt have anything to say to me since Im not one of his constituents, and the last time I was in New Jersey I was repulsed by the smell of industrial fumes along the New Jersey Turnpike. Finally, I gather my wits and conclude, Who cares? So, I walk over to where Rush Holt is standing. Well, actually, I walk up to Rep Holts staffer (Sean) and thank him for giving such a helpful presentation at the AAAS yesterday. While Sean and I are talking, Congressman Holt walks up to me. Rush Holt: Hi, Im Rush Holt.Um, no kidding. Me: Im Anna Ho. Im an undergraduate at MIT majoring in physics.Rush Holt: Physics!Me: Yes, I gather that we have something in common!Oh, dear. Someone sound the socially awkward alarm.Rush Holt: Who do you work with at MIT?Is Rush Holt intimately familiar with MITs physics department...? I give him a few names. He asks where Im from and what my research is about. We talk about pulsars, and at some point Rush Holt says "yes, I know what pulsars are. I'm a physicist!" At this point, a number of people are trying to get Rep. Holts attention, to tell him that its speech time. I excuse myself and go sit with the rest of the American Astronomical Society delegation, as the Congressman heads to the podium.  I miss his first few sentences, because I'm busy wondering how many people can say that they've talked to a Congressman about pulsars. *     *     * The United States House of Representatives occupies three office buildings along Independence Avenue. Breakfast with Rush Holt took place in one of them. We arrived there at 7:30am and waited in a long line to walk through metal detectors. The nice view of the Capitol Building nearly made up for the fact that it was FREEZING outside (Dear Washington DC: that was a pitiful excuse for Spring.)  Ive been on Capitol Hill for two days. Two days were enough to learn that things here unfold on VERY SHORT TIMESCALES. Yesterday, for example, we learned about a proposal to raise the FY 2015 NSF (National Science Foundation) budget from $7.25 billion to $7.5 billion. We were encouraged to urge our representatives to sign onto this letter. In order to urge intelligently, we had to memorize the following: its a Dear Colleague letter addressed to Chairman Frank Wolf and ranking member Chaka Fattah of the House CJS Appropriations Subcommittee, Congressman Butterfields office is leading the letter, the staff contact is Dennis Sills, and the deadline for signing is 1pm March 27. We are meeting with our representatives today, and March 27 is tomorrow. My team is comprised of myself, a graduate student from Georgia Tech, and an astronomer from the Harvard-Smithsonian Institute for Astrophysics. This is our schedule for the day: 9:00 AM Representative Katherine Clark (Massachusetts)10:00 AM Representative John Lewis (Georgia)10:30 AM Representative Michael Capuano (Massachusetts)- lunch, presumably -1:00 PM Senator Elizabeth Warren (Massachusetts)1:30 PM Senator Saxby Chambliss (Georgia)2:00 PM Senator Ed Markey (Massachusetts)2:30 PM Senator Johnny Isakson (Georgia) Im in charge of the meetings with Representative Capuano and Senator Markey. I secured our appointments through a combination of e-mail exchanges and embarrassing phone conversations. Now, its 8:30am and time to find Rep Clarks office. I hyperventilate a little bit and skim my notes from yesterday. My name is Anna Ho, and Im a constituent living in Cambridge. Im a senior at MIT majoring in physics, but today Im here representing the American Astronomical Society. In the fall, Im going to start a PhD program in astronomy  but when I started college, I didnt think that I was cut out to be a research scientist. The summer after my sophomore year, I did an internship funded by the National Science Foundation. I loved it so much that I went back the next summer and did it again. I learned that I wanted to do research because I had the opportunity to try doing research. And I had that opportunity because of this program. I became a scientist because of this program, and I would be very happy to tell you more about it.  *     *     * You can learn a lot about a politician by looking around his office. For example, Representative John Lewis was one of the leaders of the African-American Civil Rights Movement, and you could probably piece this together from the shelves full of awards and medals. A Martin Luther King Jr. Dr. sign hangs over one of the big wooden doors, with the following quote: Public officers are the trustees and servants of the people who are at all times amenable to them. There are Coca Cola bottles everywhere. We had a similar experience in Senator Chamblisss office later in the afternoon; apparently this is a Georgia Thing. Another Georgia Thing is peanuts. Peanut bowls in both offices prompted my Georgia Tech teammate to exclaim Georgia peanuts! Similarly, stepping into Representative Capuanos office feels  at least, to this Massachusetts resident  bizarrely like stepping into a museum of home. The first thing I notice is an MIT flag on the wall, dangling with flags from all of District 7s many universities and colleges. The tables are covered with editions of the New England Journal of Medicine and local newspapers. On the wall is a picture of Jordan Hall, where I once went to watch Davie 12 sing Mendelssohns oratorio Elijah, as well as a plaque about Reach Out, an organization I volunteered with as an MIT freshman. Senator Markeys office is less home-y, so while waiting for our meeting to start I sit on the long dark red couch and stare at framed pictures: over the fireplace, Markey with Obama and Markey with Ted Kennedy, on a table to my right, Markey with Obama and Nancy Pelosi, and by the door, an aerial picture of Boston and the Charles, MIT just out of sight. *     *     * We meet with Representatives in the morning, eat lunch, then meet with Senators in the afternoon. We stand up when the staffer enters, shake hands, introduce ourselves, sit around a table. When its my turn to lead the meeting, I tell the staffer about NSF-funded research internships for undergraduates (REUs), and how having the opportunity to do science research over the summer is what made me decide to go into science research as a career. Nicole (from Georgia Tech) chimes in to say that she did an REU as an undergraduate as well, and that its also what inspired her to continue in science. Kelly (from Harvard-Smithsonian) then explains that she did an REU as an undergraduate and now runs a Solar Physics REU. I emphasize that NSF funding is crucial not just for building telescope facilities and paying researchers, but also for maintaining these important educational programs. Rep. Capuanos staffer is very interested; he pulls out a notebook, writes down the name of the program, takes notes on what were saying. He tells us that Capuanos office is totally on board with all this science funding stuff, that theyve already signed onto the NSF Dear Colleague letter, that having anecdotes like this from us is very helpful as they try to convince others to do the same. In between meetings and on the way to lunch, we walk through underground tunnels and keep an eye out for Congressmen, who are identifiable by the pins they wear. We run into Michele Bachmann while waiting for an elevator and catch a glimpse of Ted Cruz. We split up after lunch and I head over alone to the Senate building. Theres a long line inside the Senate Cafe; I sit at a table holding Paradise Lost, watching white shirts and pastel-colored ties flash by. The cafe is full of handshakes and sandwiches are tossed into paper boxes. No one seems to have time to sit and eat. And now, the Senate meetings. Turns out that Elizabeth Warren is holding a meet-and-greet:  That afternoon, there is only one moment that (initially) feels like a disaster. We're sitting with Sen. Markeys staffer, Dan, and I'm running the meeting. Dan has a PhD in physics and worked at the LHC for a while, and makes it clear from the start that his office is already on board. My brain says you have an action item! and my mouth starts moving on autopilot: My Mouth: Has Sen. Markey signed onto the Dear Colleague letter circulating in the House?Dan: ...Well, thats in the House, and were the Senate.My Brain: NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO WHY ANNA WHY Thinking quickly,Me: Well, is there an equivalent letter in the Senate?Dan: No, but I would be happy to start one. Wait, what? Dan: Its really helpful when scientists come in and give concrete suggestions for legislation they want to see. Wait, you want us to do that? Does anybody realize this? Does anybody understand the system well enough to even know what to ask for? Dan asks us to e-mail him the House letter. Still in shock, I offer my contact information as usual. Dan says that he will actually be in Cambridge in a few weeks, and would be happy to take me up on the offer of an MIT tour. A week later, Josh Shiode e-mails the AAS delegation saying Thanks to one of our teams, Senator Markeys office is leading a Dear Colleague letter in the Senate that closely mirrors the one in the House in support of $7.5 billion for NSF in FY 2015. Please send the below text and attached pdf to each of your Senate contacts and urge them to sign on to support this effort. A couple of days later, Dan e-mails me to say that the letter is circulating and 11 senators have signed on so far. Thought youd like to know! A week after that, I meet Dan in MIT's Lobby 7. Hansol '15 gives us a tour of Prof. Brad Pentelute's chemistry lab and two graduate students show us around the Man-Vehicle Lab. Between labs (getting around MIT involves a lot of walking) Dan and I discuss how to get scientists more involved in advocacy, and what a scientist's role in advocacy is in the first place. Eventually, Dan has to go get work done so I drop him off at the Stata Center. We shake hands, and I say that I'll be in touch. I mean it.  The first speech I ever gave in my life was to the 1000 of you who attended the CPW Welcome event Thursday night. It was a 5 minute, 5 step guide on "How to Do CPW", and I heard it was "amusing" though I was really going for inspirational and life-changing. Here's a gif in case you missed it:  At the time, I actually didnt know that there was a major difference since my CPW: THE EVENTS DIDNT GO PAST 2 AM. At least not officially. Come on MIT, what is that? Its breaking tradition to not have events registered around the clock. It made enough people upset that prefrosh might potentially get too much sleep, that I think its reverting back to a 24/7 schedule next year.   During CPW, there were little stations installed where you could fold cranes from white paper. I noticed them filling up over the weekend, though I didnt take a closer look. The end result? A HACK!! It was raised from the ceiling of Stata the night before the one-year memorial of Officer Sean Collier. It was such a stunning and poignant tribute that some people didn't realize it was a hack. I really commend those who put it together.  Then came Ring Delivery, which was the day after I went to an Iggy Azalea concert. Honestly, freshman year, I wasn't particularly interested in the brass rat. I thought "I don't like wearing jewelry, and anyway, it's expensive." Ive changed my mind since then, and think it is a genuinely special object due to its symbolism. As for the finances, I heard RingComm had funds left over that they were turning into subsidies for students. This was already demonstrated at Ring Premiere, because the first person in line won a free ring (hint for future years!). So as the rumor went, you had to get in line early for ring sales to get a subsidy. Therefore, Cara L. and I woke up at 6:30 am on a Saturday to get in line for 10 am sales: we were the 6th and 7th people in line! Turns out we didnt need to be so early because the first 100 students got $100 off. No regrets, because for the 3 hours I was in line I was technically making $33.33 an hour, whoot whoot.  Obligatory photo compilation:  Kara P., Yami P., Anna L., and Justin C. This semester, I moved out of East Campus (after moving out of Baker) and into Simmons Hall (where blogger legendary Elizabeth C. '13 lived). You can see the new Simmons 2014 i3 video here. I live in C-Tower, and have pretty much a penthouse view of the Charles. I really love my section, and what's not to love when we were the Scooter Hockey Champions of the first annual simmons competition last week, whazam! Decked out with our retro-neon-game-faces, we scootered our way to viCTory.   Garrett S. '17, Andres A. '17, Evan D. '17, Nick M. '17, Nadia M. '17, Alex D. '17, Sean K. '14,  Christina S. '14, Cosmos D. '15, Hesham '15, and Alison O. (GRT) As a final update, on Friday, Fossil Free MIT revealed a campus-wide statement called the "Blue Line." From their website, it states:  Fossil Free MIT gained permission from MIT Facilities before executing this, and will be removing the tape today. However, this project seemed to gain mixed response from MIT's population, as well as reddit's, which claims: "I'm not sure if wrapping the campus in a petroleum product is the best way to get this message across." I'll update if there is more news soon. This past Friday was the nth annual Tetazoo faculty dinner -  a great event filled with our favorite foods, faculty, staff, random graduate students, and friends! This year we had over 16 different faculty and staff from across MIT, including our very own Chris Peterson!  We decorated the lounge for the occasion, and we spent the whole day cooking in the kitchen preparing food for our favorite professors and instructors!            Pictures of Food                 Baby Marie Our most honored guest was the 1 1/2 year-old baby Marie, the child of our GRTs (Graduate Resident Tutors) who live on our hall.  She got special privileges such as first dibs on food and a special seat outside of the GRT apartment.   The Faculty  Once the faculty started to arrive, we had a greeter at the door to welcome them to our hall.  Most of us were dressed in our hall shirts, featuring our hall mascot, the Squanch!   And we had a special occasion! It was Professor Ron Roscoe's 75th birthday - and he spent it on Tetazoo! We were honored, and Kayla E. '15 made him a beautiful birthday cake, decorated in circuits. We all sang - normally :O - and I think he really enjoyed our celebration and the cake!   And Chris Peterson was there!! I invited him to hang out with the crazy kids he admitted, and I think he had a really good time! Unfortunately, he didn't get to eat any Angel Food Cake. He only got to look at six pieces.    But Petey hated the cats since he is allergic and thinks they are terrible. HOW CAN YOU HATE THIS FACE, PETEY!?  All in all, the nth annual Tetazoo Faculty Dinner event was a huge success, and now we have enough leftovers to last us weeks! Yay not going hungry! After rocking the jeans + sweater/t-shirt look for almost an entire school year, two events occurred last Thursday and Friday that required a slightly more spiffy outfit choice: Ring Delivery (also blogged by Rachel) and the end-of-season fencing banquet. Here are some thoughts if youre into that kind of thing.  The Photography of Ring Delivery: Ridiculous Poses and Pictures of HandsA data summary-esque analysis by Ceri AbstractRing Delivery is a time-honored tradition in which Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) students gather to receive small chunks of molded, semi-precious or precious metal for which they paid large sums of money several months prior. After receiving their ring, colloquially called a Brass Rat, individuals usually feel pride, joy, and a slight sense of dread (or perhaps elation) because they are nearing the end of their sophomore year and the halfway point of their MIT career. This peculiar brew of emotions leads individuals to document their experience in odd ways, especially through very distinct poses and photographs. As such, this study will analyze primary examples of these photographs and attempt to elucidate why such great effort is put into emphasizing the presence of a new piece of jewelry.Materials and MethodsAll photographs were donated by Rachel R. 16. Accompanying figures were digitized using an iPhone 4 camera and created using a Pentel mechanical pencil, an ultra fine point Sharpie marker, and a Tombow N79 brush pen. Results and Figures   Figure 1. Participants pledge allegiance to MIT. This photograph depicts the most common group pose found at Ring Premiere, in which several people smile and hold their ring-bearing hands with flat palms over their chest area. Pictured here are myself, Rachel R. 16, Lauren W. 16, and Nick A. 16, aka two-thirds of the coolest suite to ever have existed (an unbiased assessment). While almost everyone participates in a Ring Premiere photograph of this genre, this may also be the most ridiculous picture from a non-MIT perspective. Clearly the intent of participants is to appear excited for the new status symbols upon their fingers, but each Brass Rat is reduced to but a small glimmer. Participants take a traditional stance with their right hand over the heart region and appear to be pledging allegiance to MIT, a beaver, engineering, IHTFP, stress, Tim the beaver, symbolism, materialism, or some other unknown force. Further study is required to identify to what or to whom they are pledging.   Figure 2. A superhero resides within every MIT student. While a slightly less common pose, oftentimes with smaller groups of 2-3 individuals, this photograph depicts students displaying their rings with clenched fists. Students may smile, as in this example with Alex O. 16 and Rachel R. 16., or adopt a scowl or more serious facial expression to amplify intensity. This genre of picture represents the inner desire to be a superhero within all MIT students. While many would say that these pictures parallel the heroic nature of Tony Stark/Iron Man, MITs celebrity comic book hero, the presence of the Brass Rat in lieu of an arc reactor seems to invoke imagery of the Wonder Twins. The Wonder Twins powers were invoked by forming contact between their rings, at which point Zan (the male) would be able to assume any form of water, and Jayna (the female) would be able to transform into any animal. Perhaps MIT students hope that their rings will bestow similar powers, like knowledge or the ability to transform into an oversized beaver.   Figure 3. Students comMIT to an engagement with a university. This type of photograph is designed to emphasize the details of both the Brass Rat and/or the manicures of the student, as depicted by the hands of Rachel R. '16 and Lesley W. '16. In a similar vein are the pictures of the MIT ring box with the Brass Rat nestled inside; not pictured here. The most common caption to these photographs is some variation on MIT finally put a ring on it, or Engaged to the institute! While this quip is in reference to the fact that most people wear Brass Rats on their right hand ring finger, participants do not appear to consider the extent of this metaphor. Perhaps it is an acknowledgement that life at MIT is like a rocky marriagethe first part of freshman year is the honeymoon phase, but then students end up living in the academic buildings and sleeping on couches, raising stress levels, and investing large sums of money to make the university happy. Eventually, this engagement will end in a divorce, when these students graduate and move on with their lives as a new batch of hopefuls fill their place. Discussion and ConclusionsThrough this study, we have discovered that MIT students are proud of their quest to survive their undergraduate career, and this pride manifests itself in the form of strange photographs upon receiving a status symbol of attending the aforementioned institution. While strange to an outsider, these photographs appear annually on MIT students social media websites around the last week of April. This tradition will most likely continue as long as Brass Rats are being distributed at a Ring Delivery, which, in all predictions, may be many centuries to come. On a separate (totally not giving you whiplash) note, the day immediately following Ring Delivery was the first chance for the fencing sophomores to show off their new rings at a different formal-ish event, the end of the year fencing banquet. To my knowledge, a lot of sports teams have some form of our-seasons-over-but-we-should-eat-food-or-something-because-you-guys-are-cool type event, and this is the fencing teams version. There is food, merriment, gifts for graduating seniors, special award nominations (for example, the Anne Zabladoff Award for Fencing Masochism or most Clueless Sophomore), and paper plate awards for everyone involved with the team. I dont have any particularly snarky commentary re: photos taken at this event, so here are a couple courtesy of Sherry R. 15. Theres a group photo of the entire team + coaches, the (almost entire) foil squad, 5/6 of womens foil (self-proclaimed highest attendance, lowest attention span), and mens foil making fun of womens foil (plus a rogue mens sabre).         As exams become more and more of a reality that I can't ignore, I find my weekly/fortnightly blogs slowly phasing themselves out. As such I thought I'd steal a simple format from the wonderful NPR podcast Pop Culture Happy Hour and just tell you guys a few things that made me happy this week. The rules are simple, what I post needs to be something that you can also enjoy (called the Zaxxon Rule) and the post shan't be too long.  I was lucky enough to see this movie on April 12th(I realize this was a few weeks ago but it's still making me happy), thanks to the early UK release date, and I absolutely loved it. A huge fan of the original three movies (yes, even the third one)  Spider-Man 2 was always one of my favorite movies and this movie knocked it of its throne. While I still feel like Tobey Maguire plays the better Peter Parker, Andrew Garfield has Spider-Man on lock.  A few weeks back my future boss sent me a few books to check out before I started my internship. Sceptical about the title for this one I put off reading it and spent my free time catching up on a few fantasy books. After finishing The Wise Man's Fear I decided to pick it up and enjoy the beautiful Spring weather. What I found was a wonderful book filled with useful tips and dozens of anecdotes of when these simple steps made a big difference in how a few greats, such as Lincoln, Roosevelt and Andrew Carnegie, ran the country and their businesses. This is a must read for anyone who going into an internship this summer.  When Ernesto '15 and I visited Amsterdam a few weeks back one of our stops was at the de Appel Arts Centre where we found a wonderful exhibition about the artist Nina Yuen. I can't put my finger on what it is about the videos but we sat there and patiently watched all 40+ minutes in a trance. The video above, Heather Who, was my favorite of the bunch.  Sarah Kay is without a doubt one of my favorite spoken word poets and her new poem Ghost Ship is a great example why.   And with that I'll finish with asking you guys a simple question, what's making you happy this week? The college admissions process is often compared to dating. It's a dance that happens between students and colleges where the power dynamic shifts back and forth several times; one courts the other, then the other courts the first, and so on. We spend time and money trying to identify the right students who could be great candidates for our institutions, and do all kinds of outreach--traveling the country, visiting high schools, giving presentations, campus tours, sending brochures and emails...all in hopes that they'll apply to our school. We wait in anticipation to see the applications roll in. Students enter into the application process, picking and choosing which colleges they want to apply to. For those whom we are lucky enough to receive their applications, we read them, learn about their lives, fall in love with many, but can only choose a few. Applicants wait with bated breath to hear back, nervous and anxious, constantly hitting refresh to find out their decision. The tables turn again--once we've admitted a class of students, we begin to court them once more. Shiny tubes, greeting cards, and a four-day extravaganza called Campus Preview Weekend. Now it's our turn to wait, excited and eager, hoping the applicants we love so much will say "yes" in return. And that brings us to today. Many have said yes; welcome to the family! Some have said no; we'll eat a couple pints of ice cream, and all will be okay. But then there are others who haven't said anything yet... If you were admitted to a college, I'm sure you can remember what it was like, constantly hitting refresh, and waiting in anticipation to hear responses from the college(s) you applied to. For the last several weeks, we've now been doing the same. Every day, hitting refresh, waiting to hear back from the 1,419 students we extended admission offers to. (If you think waiting for a handful of college decisions is stressful, try waiting for 1,419 replies.) The deadline has come and gone, and for those of you who haven't responded yet (who haven't been granted extensions for financial aid reasons), I'm guessing most of you have decided to go to another place. That's perfectly fine--we completely understand. There are tons of amazing schools out there, and we know you've made a choice that is right for you. The only thing we ask in return, is that you please let us know. Log in to your MyMIT account, and click on "How to accept or decline our offer of admission", and complete the form. I know breaking up is hard to do, but not knowing is even worse. Plus, it doesn't have to be goodbye forever--we can still be friends...and there's always grad school. :) Thanks for dancing with us, and we look forward to hearing from you soon. P.S. This applies to pretty much every college out there, so if you have other schools you haven't responded to yet, do that too! P.P.S. For those on the waitlist, we haven't forgotten about you either! As you can see above, we empathize with the pain of waiting and not knowing, and want to get back to you as quickly as possible. More news to come soon, I promise.  It's May 1st. Most of your friends have decided where they are going to college in the fall and can sleep soundly.  But making a choice is a little harder for your situation. You may be overwhelmed thinking about prices, distance from home, community, and/or ability to perform well at MIT.      First of all, please     and let's review a few common questions you may have about enrolling at MIT.   1. Are there normal people there?/Are 'my kind of people' at MIT? With 457 different student groups, different dorm personalities and the insane amount of activities happening regularly, the short answer is yes. If you don't want to take my word for it, comment with your must-have interest and I'll look into it.   (This is an activities bulletin board outside my office).   2. I don't think I can handle the curriculum at MIT. Don't let imposter syndome win! We accepted you because we know that you can have a successful MIT career. Here are some wise words from Mikey, our director of selection, who has experienced the same doubts. If you're still worried, there are services available to help you succeed and you'll have a faculty or staff advisor who can help guide you during your four years at the 'tute.   3. I don't think my parents and I can afford MIT. We know that the cost of MIT factors into most students decision processes. Members of the Student Financial Services staff are available to you to answer any remaining questions that might be lingering for you or your family.   Remember that the value of MIT is worth more than the price of the education. Youll be a part of a unique community of problem-solvers receiving a hands-on education that provides opportunities for undergrad research, internship opportunities, and study abroad experiences. ^_^    4. How do I enroll? Log in to your myMIT account and select "I will enroll at MIT for the term beginning September, 2014.*" (There are other options, but you're on your own there.) That's it! No deposit required.  If you think about these questions and decide MIT is not the place for you, we thank you for letting us get to know you this year and wish you the best...    Are there other questions you have about enrolling? I'll be around answering them until 11:59 PM EST tonight to help you make your decision!  In just four short weeks, my time as a MIT freshman will draw to a close. Boxes will be packed, old psets that I will probably never look at again will be thrown away, and students will be scattering across the world for the three months we call summer break. Ive had the opportunity to try so many new and wildly amazing experiences here, some of which Ive recorded in the semi-permanent realm of the blogosphere (who are we kidding, the internet is forever), and I look forward to the ones Ill have in the future. Finals week will mark the end of an era and slowly, one by one, people will leave for internships, MISTI, vacations, or whatever else piques their interest. But its not really goodbye. After all, we have the consolation of knowing that come fall semester, we will all be returning to the familiar rhythm of psets, friends, and free food. Of course, the nature of college renders that last statement faulty in one regard: not all of us will be returning. The new semester marks not only the exciting arrival of the class of 2018, but also the bittersweet departure of the class of 2014. On one hand, we are proud of their accomplishments and wish them only the best in whatever future lies before them. On the other hand, there will always be a whatever-shape-awesome-people-are shaped hole in all of our hearts. Friday was the varsity tennis teams last home game of the year and, consequently, Senior Day, a day to celebrate the seniors and all that theyve accomplished. This year we had two graduating seniors, Lauren and Julia, and we were determined to make it one of the greatest senior days ever. Here is a recipe that I have recorded for posterity: Ingredients: 1 tray of brownie-cookie-dough-Oreo hybrid dessert2 meticulously designed photo collages (Alana 16 is a wizard at making collages)1 pack of goofy 2014 glittery new years paper glasses, courtesy of the internet2 colorful posters for maximum cheering1 heartfelt coaches speech1 instrumental version of Bruno Mars Treasure to sing along with Directions: Prepare the ingredients in the secrecy of someones dorm room, preferably in the company of your fellow teammates. Secretly eat some of the Oreos before they get baked. Begin senior day with heartfelt speeches and gifts from the coaches, followed by a presentation of the team gifts. Ensure that everyone is wearing their goofy glasses and end the mini ceremony with an impeccable (coughcough) group rendition of Treasure, complete with (questionable) choreography and rhythmic mumbling when the revised lyrics are forgotten. Win the match and celebrate the final home game of the season. Makes 1 serving. I started playing tennis when I was 8 years old at my local community park, the majority of my time on the court spent running around in circles and laughing with my friends. At the time, the mechanics of the sport were second in importance to the excitement of the games and youthful camaraderie. As I got older, practices became focused and I began to compete in individual tournaments. I made some amazing friends while travelling to national tournaments around the country, but tennis became more and more of an individual sport and the hours spent running around in circles with friends turned into hours of drills, conditioning, and matches. I loved playing tennis though, so I never really noticed the solitude of an individual sport until high school when I joined the tennis team and rediscovered the same camaraderie that I had had when I was 8. At MIT, as a part of the varsity tennis team, Im happy to say that Ive found the same thing here: a second family. Everyone brings something unique and amazing to the team and I cant imagine it being any other way. Of course, this solidarity is partly an inevitable byproduct of the amount of time that we spend together each week on and off the court.  The team huddles together to celebrate the last home match of the season. I think there might also be a sandwich on the ground. I'm not sure. Like many other fall sports, we started pre-season practice a week before classes started, breaking in new tennis balls while freshman orientation was in full swing. Practice is a daily affair from 5:15-7pm and we have matches virtually every weekend, some at home and a rare few a couple of hours away by bus. Only weeks ago, during our spring season, we played a match at Vassar College in New York and spent the four hour bus ride back playing road trip games and trying not to lose our sanity (though we did discover an appalling lack of desserts that start with the letter E). There is certainly a substantial time commitment that comes with being a student-athlete, one that becomes particularly noticeable when you find yourself staring at the fascinating patterns on the back of the bus seats instead of attending one of the countless events that usually take place on a fine Saturday night. But thankfully, my professors and TAs have been very understanding whenever I have had to skip class for tennis so the only problem I face is finding the time to catch up on the material I have missed. Being a part of the team has solidified my belief that while some things can be done alone, it doesnt mean they have to be; having your friends and team mates around to support you makes things infinitely better. Its like the difference between eating a piece of bread and eating a piece of bread with peanut butter, Nutella, and bananas cheering you on. Unless youre allergic to peanut butter, in which case that was probably a really bad analogy. Our season wraps up with NCAA regionals next weekend and while Friday was the last home match, next weekend could be our last match of the school year. Well be saying goodbye to daily practices, to bumpy bus rides, and to blurry pictures of my friends lecture notes from the classes Ive missed. Most importantly, well be saying goodbye to the seniors. I know Ive only gotten to know them for a year, but its been such a year of unforgettable moments. Next year Ill be a sophomore and the cycle will begin again: new faces, new friends, new family, and the fond memory of all the seniors that have come before. Thankfully, underneath all this change, the joy of the sport and the friendships formed will always be constant. Ive been playing tennis for eleven years now and I dont plan on stopping any time soon. In the future, if you ever see an eighty year old lady running around in circles on a tennis court and laughing with other similarly aged yet surprisingly spry senior citizens, its probably me, rediscovering the same happiness that I had when I was 8 and that I have right now.  You: Where are you from?Me: London.You: But you...you don't...you don't seem to have a British accent.Me: Correct. Let me explain! I was born in Singapore, had a Singaporean accent, then moved to London during the summer before fifth... read more  see complete archives  Books wrote our life story, and as they accumulated on our shelves (and on our windowsills, and underneath our sofa, and on top of our refrigerator), they became chapters in it themselves. How could it be otherwise?     -Anne Fadiman, in the preface to her essay collection Ex Libris * * * There are 37 days before graduation, so I decided that Room Cleaning must begin. I started with my bookshelf, since that seems to be where clutter ultimately accumulates. I unfolded a cardboard box, switched on my desk lamp, and sat down cross-legged on the carpet. I pulled out loose papers. What if I need those vector calculus equation sheets in six years?! Anna, you have them now and you still look everything up on Google. Recycling bin. What if, in ten years, getting a job hinges on having my notes from organic chemistry lecture freshman spring?!? Um, right. Recycling bin.  At some point, I took a break to refill my mug, pausing on my way out the door to switch off the desk lamp. One night during the summer before tenth grade, I put a similar lamp and mug on the floor of a dorm room closet at Franklin & Marshall College. I dutifully turned off the room lights (my summer camp had a strict lights-out policy) then crawled into the closet, pulled the doors shut behind me, and read the newly-released Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows from cover-to-cover while crouching underneath my t-shirts. When I shut the book, I cried. That series had been a steady companion. * * * First into the cardboard box were the books I forgot I owned, followed by the books I had no intention of revisiting. Three categories of books survived the cull: used  but still useful  textbooks, books I havent yet read but am eager to read, and books I regard as old friends. The first category includes Shankar's Principles of Quantum Mechanics and the second includes Le Morte dArthur and The Silmarillion by J.R.R. Tolkien (I owe Prof. Bahr for much of my current reading list.) The third category fills a half-shelf that I would gladly haul across the globe. On the far left is Platos Gorgias. There is a convoluted flowchart opposite the inside cover, in some previous iteration of my handwriting. Callicles points to pleasure and Socrates points to "happiness." Pleasure and happiness are boxed and connected, and labeled Callicles mistakenly assumes that they are the same. There is an arrow from happiness to orderliness, and another from orderliness to cosmic order. On the top of page 105 I wrote what is the ultimate goal of the good life? and on the very last page I underlined to such a degree of lack of education have we come! I read Gorgias in 11th grade, in a semester elective called Early Classical Thought. Mr. Potchatek stood at the window gazing at passers-by while we students sat around an oval table and grappled valiantly with the following question: what the heck is Socrates talking about? I could tell that Mr. Potchatek was listening intently because every now and then our conversation made him smile or frown, and occasionally he wandered over to pose new questions that stunned us all into silence. He never answered his own questions; he let us sit in silence until one of us answered. One day, at the end of class, he told me that the text was still confusing him. He handed me a board marker and asked for my help. I got up at the board while he sat on the table, and together we drew a flowchart that I very happily copied into my copy of Gorgias. Sometimes, when the psets are getting me down and I need a boost, I peek at that flow chart and remember how that moment felt. * * * In July, my annotated Gorgias will travel with me to Marburg, Germany, for an intensive German language course. Then well head south to Heidelberg, and Gorgias will live in my new apartment for a year while I commute to and from the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy. My research question is how did the Milky Way form? and my approach will be to measure and calculate the ages of stars and watch the process unfold. I decided to try out astronomy research during my sophomore year at MIT, partly because I was captivated by a book called First Light. First Light resides two books away from Gorgias, separated by The Language of God by Francis Collins (a gift from a friend as part of our ongoing discussion about whether religion can be reconciled with science) and The Invention of Love by Tom Stoppard (which I read in Prof. Diana Hendersons wonderful Studies in Drama course at MIT). First Light was written by Richard Preston, a science writer who spent many months with a group of astronomers, like (in his own words) Jane Goodall among the chimpanzees. The book is an intimate portrait of obsession: of the kind of person who can be an astronomer, of marching to the slow pace of scientific progress, of the persistence required for discovery. Exaclty how this came to pass is a long story and I'll skip it here, but Preston autographed and mailed me this copy of the book, writing: For Anna Ho, Good luck in all your adventures  keep looking up.  One of the main characters in First Light is Jim Gunn. Preston describes him as a professor at Princeton University overflowing with awards and prizes, but most comfortable in a brown sweater drilled with moth holes and glasses padded around the nose with a wad of electrical tape. I met Jim Gunn a little over a month ago. Actually, its probably more accurate to say that I hunted Jim Gunn down, a little more than a month ago. I was on a graduate school visit and asked Prof. Jill Knapp (his wife) where he was. She led me down to the basement, explaining that he hides behind the vacuum tube. Knock, knock. Jim? Jim Gunn peeked out from behind the metal monstrosity. This is Anna Ho. Shes on a graduate school visit and wants to meet you. And just like that, I was sitting with Jim Gunn behind an enormous vacuum tube. I asked what it was used for, and he said that its not used for anything and its just too big to get out of the room. We spent the next twenty minutes chatting about First Light, what good science writing is, our favorite science fiction authors, and the importance of having breadth as a scientist. Finally, I asked him for his signature and now best of everything! Jim Gunn is taped next to Prestons note.  * * * Much of First Light takes place at Caltechs Palomar Observatory, so there will be something deeply romantic and satisfying about taking the book with me when I move from Heidelberg to Pasadena in order to begin pursuing my astronomy PhD at Caltech. When I'm banging my head against the wall fitting datasets or writing telescope proposals, Preston and Gunn will remind me of the big picture.  I love astronomy and doing astronomy research, but Im a little nervous about becoming a graduate student. In his book Awakenings, the neurologist Oliver Sacks describes the feeling as follows: we are over-developed in mechanical competence, but lacking in biological intelligence, intuition, awareness; and it is this, above all, that we need to regain, not only in medicine, but in all science. For Sacks, a doctor, the point is that treating" or "curing" a human being is a lot more than wielding a syringe. It can and should involve compassionate listening and emotional support. We risk forgetting that as we become more technologically advanced. Im not a doctor and my science is less obviously related to human beings, but as an undergraduate I've happily engaged with people through teaching and public outreach, and enjoyed pursuing a variety of interests through classes. At MIT, surrounded by the very highest mechanical competence, I feel like I was rescued by my humanities classes and my various extracurricular activities: I became a much better teacher and writer and speaker, and learned about cultures and civilizations in addition to scientific ideas and numerical techniques. All that said, Ive been told that the goal of graduate school is to focus and Im not sure how to best stay in touch with other interests and values.  Awakenings reminds me of all of this, so it sits on my bookshelf, leaning on First Light. * * * I spent the first semester of senior year frantically trying to make plans for the future: interviews, phone calls, essays, applications, letters of recommendation, presentations. This semester, those plans are set and my task is to transition out of here. The hardest part is deciding what should come with me and what should stay behind. It took me two hours spread over three days to trim down my bookshelf, and I'm still not feeling comfortable about all those old psets... Next up are my clothes. I just took out a new cardboard box, and tossed in a pair of sweatpants that I want to donate. While I work on that, go take a look at your bookshelf (if you haven't already) and tell me (I'm curious): which books have kept you company for a long time? It's that time of year again - SpringFest!  This past weekend was filled with fun events like the McCormick Hall picnic and lots of energy saving activities.  But my personal favorite event was SpringFest's annual concert, featuring Capital Cities and Flosstradamus! The opening act was Scavenger Hunt, and they were really awesome! I got to test out my new camera during their set, and I am pretty happy with the results.      After the first three songs, I had some down time to go around and see some friends!  There were about 9 EMTs roaming around that I got to hang out with, as well as some friends from East Campus!   Then it was time for Capital Cities!  They were fantastic - the trumpet solos especially were incredible!        And then the final act - Flosstradamus! They definitely got the crowd moving and jumping all around.   Overall, the concert was great, the set-up was beautiful, and SpringFest was a success :)  Last night, MIT sophomores dressed in black-tie attire flocked to the beautiful State Room in Boston to receive their glorious Brass Rats! Michael C. '16 explained in his post about Ring Premiere what the design of our ring looks like, but as of last night we now have our own beautiful rings to show to the world on our beautiful 2016 hands! LOOK AT MY PRETTY RING!  It feels so good! I have many pictures from and of the event, mostly of my fellow Tetazoa and other East Campusers, but some with and of friends in my class that I was really excited to see! We had a great time, and afterwards a bunch of us went to Bova's Bakery to get Cannoli's together! Here are some pictures of the event and of my beautiful friends!    We even got to take a series of prom pictures!      We also took more prom pictures once we got to the event!    It definitely felt like prom - the view from the State room was absolutely gorgeous!  We got some really nice shots in front of the beautiful view.   And here is Nico F. '16, one of the members of RingComm, the committee that plans ring delivery and designed our beautiful ring!  AND THEN I FOUND HARRY B. '16!! Yay Harry! He's so Canadian!   Of course I needed a picture with Harry! Thanks to Will R. '16 for taking this picture! Here is Will:  I also got a picture with Jake I. '16! We took a "selfie."  And Random Hall showed up to the event in full black-tie attire :)  There was a beautiful ice sculpture in the shape of a ring! Sadly, the sculpture mysteriously disapeared a while into the event.  THE VENUE WAS SO PRETTY AND CLASSY!    THAT VIEW!  And there were so many photographers! Eurah K. '16 and I took pictures with our fancy cameras.  We also had a mini Intel STS '12 reunion! We couldn't find Adam K. '16, sadly, but we did have Ani P. '16, Jin P. '16, Jordan C. '16 and me!  And I found some of my course 3 friends! Here are Isabel C. '16 and I with our new Brass Rats! Photo taken by Nick M. '16:  And here are Nick and Isabel looking pretty!  Tetazoo arrived at Ring Delivery initially with Beast, the second floor of the east parallel (we are the third floor, known as the third east traveling animal zoo).  However, as the night progressed, we found ourselves additionally hanging out with Florey, the fifth floor. Usually we have a small rivalry with that floor, but last night we put our differences aside in order to potentially accomplish greater things.    After ring delivery, a bunch of us went to Bova's to get cannoli's!  So overall, the event was a huge success! We had a bunch of fun dressing up, goofing off, and just hanging out together as a class.   And finally, as always, I will end this post with pictures of cats! Today is Galileo and Thor's third birthday!!! They got wet food as a birthday present from their wonderful owner, Kerry N. '14.    If you're a regular on /r/technology, you might have seen Project Naptha trending the front page. I've blogged a couple of times already about hackathons at MIT and how amazing they are in the amount of experience, learning, and motivation they can give you in the space of ten or twenty sleepless hours. Project Naptha, created by my classmate Kevin K. '17, is a Chrome extension whose birth I witnessed (and blogged about) at HackMIT last October. Then called "ImagesAsText," he took home second prize (and $2000) for his work. What, exactly, does Project Naptha do? From the website: You can see it in action on the Project Naptha website. It's pretty amazing. Essentially, it detects text from memes, image macros, screenshots, graphs, scanned images, and even certain photographs (yes, that includes rotated text) and treats it as highlightable text. Then, using some nifty image processing, it allows you to remove that text from the image entirely, or replace it with its translation in a different language, or replace it with whatever text you desire. There's even an Easter egg that gives the selected text an animation. It does all of this image processing in real time, with no discernible lag or delay. It can do this for pretty much every language on the Internet, including non-latinate languages like Chinese and Russian. Kevin is kind of a hacker extraordinaire. Project Naptha has since been picked up by PCWorld, the Verge, Engadget, and CNET. CNET calls it "nothing short of JavaScript black magic." Since its release yesterday, it has had upward of 52,000 downloads (as of 5:09 PM EDT on April 25).  It's not perfect, but it comes very, very close, really limited only by the technologies of optical character recognition, translation quality, and the image processing that fills in the image where text is removed (think Photoshop's Content Aware Fill). The only question really left is--can it do Captchas? Signing off, Allan Add Project Naptha to Chrome here. For demos and backstory, check out the website. You: Where are you from?Me: London.You: But you...you don't...you don't seem to have a British accent.Me: Correct. Let me explain! I was born in Singapore, had a Singaporean accent, then moved to London during the summer before fifth... read more  see complete archives  My name is Anna Ho, and I am a student at  No, no. Thats not the point. My name is Anna Ho, and I am a constituent living in Cambridge. I am a student at MIT majoring in physics. Ugh, I sound like a robot. Sound cheerful! BE cheerful! ITS SO EXCITING TO BE HERE! Hi! Thank you so much for taking the time to meet with us. My name is Anna Ho, and Im a constituent living in Cambridge. Im a senior at MIT majoring in physics, but today Im here representing the American Astronomical Society. ...and Im very nervous, because Im an idealistic 21-year-old who would really like to think that its better to Engage than it is to Criticise From Afar, and somehow I find myself here in DC to meet with my representatives. Ive heard that people charge into policy work feeling like theyre going to change the world, and soon become disenchanted and frustrated. And Im afraid that on Wednesday, I will find out that all of these meetings with my representatives are just formalities to win my vote. * * * Our training begins on Monday March 24. Around ten of us have arrived in DC already, and we start by going around the room and introducing ourselves. The guy to my left works at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Maryland, building cameras for telescopes. The woman to my right does research on the sun at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. Theres a professor from Northwestern somewhere behind me. There are a handful of graduate students, and Im the token undergraduate. The first speaker is Josh Shiode. Josh has a PhD in astronomy from UC Berkeley and is now a John Bahcall Public Policy Fellow at the American Astronomical Society (AAS). Translation: he brought his scientific training and communication talents with him to the policy world of Washington D.C. He communicates in two directions: he advocates on behalf of the astronomy community to policymakers, and keeps the astronomy community informed about important changes in policy. This week, his job is to prepare a delegation of 15 AAS members to lobby on Capitol Hill. This Monday afternoon, his talk is called Congress in Context. I frantically take notes, trying to go from Zero Knowledge to Enough Knowledge. Congress in Context: Josh walks us through how a bill becomes a law (the takeaway: very few do) and introduces us to important vocabulary. The deficit, for example. Non-defense discretionary spending (our stuff!) and the nature of its shrinking. The Budget Control Act, the Bipartisan Budget Act, high spending on mandatory programs, the difference between authorizations and appropriations (the theory and the reality), examples of authorizing committees, examples of appropriating committees. Current status: the Presidents Budget Request  which proposes spending levels for each agency  is out. Now, Congress is working on actually allocating funding (appropriations), in theory within the authorized bounds. There are many organizations lobbying on Capitol Hill for a piece of nondefense discretionary pie, and we are one of them. No pressure. After a short coffee break (astronomers have caffeine running through their veins) we reconvene for a talk by Anna Quider, who works at the US State Department. Anna is another PhD astronomer who decided to dedicate her life to policy, and her job this afternoon is to introduce us to our audience. Our audience is: Congressional Staff. Before you walk into the House or the Senate, she says, you need to understand who these people are. Each Member of Congress has a group of Congressional Staff (staffers) who distill and relay information to the congressman about particular issues, to help him or her cast an informed vote. This sounds like an enormous responsibility, so I am astonished to learn that some staffers are not a whole lot older than I am. For many staffers, Anna tells us, this is their FIRST JOB EVER. Theyre smart 20- or 30-something year olds, expected to become experts in a wide variety of areas often outside their educational background. When Anna was a staffer, her portfolio included education, small business and entrepreneurship, national security, innovation, and all of science and technology. When the staffer in charge of healthcare issues left, Anna was given that job, and told: well, science is the next closest thing.  To help staffers, there is a non-partisan knowledge tank on Capitol Hill called the Congressional Research Service. But even with this resource, consider what the job entails: teaching yourself about a vast range of complicated and important issues that you have limited (or no) academic experience with, picking out the salient points, then relaying information up the chain to a Member of Congress. With this in mind, Anna shows us a typical staffer schedule: it is packed from 8am until 9pm, with no obvious breaks.  The fact that [the staffer you contacted] took your meeting request is a small miracle, Anna said. You have a foot in the door. These are a PRECIOUS TWENTY MINUTES. She mentions that our 30-minute scheduled meeting might end up lasting two minutes and be held standing in a hallway, or even turn out to include a bunch of other scientists from other organizations. Thanks to Anna, I have a mental image of the very hard-working but very busy person I will be meeting with on Wednesday. Obviously, I cant waste this persons time. What is special about me? What information can I uniquely deliver? * * * The last session on Monday is led by Jen Greenamoyer, a Senior Government Relations Liaison at the American Institute of Physics. With her, we will finally begin to hammer out what exactly to say during our meetings. The talk is titled: Delivering Your Message on Capitol Hill and I take away five key points: Heads swimming, we break into groups for a roleplay activity. I become Jason Ellis, lobbyist for an organization called Save Our Coastal Resources. The Space Telescope Science Institute astronomer to my left becomes congresswoman Katherine Greer, a Republican from Oregon who is currently undecided about how to vote on a bill. The Harvard-Smithsonian astronomer to my right becomes Allison Lowder, a lobbyist for the U.S. Shrimpers Association. We each have something like 5 minutes to skim a briefing on the bill, then hold a meeting with the congresswoman trying to persuade her to vote one way or the other. Allison Lowder holds her meeting while I run out to the bathroom, and I come back pumped to argue on behalf of SOCR. The Sawfish will become extinct if no steps are taken to protect it, I say. All life on our planet is connected and dependent on each other, and there is serious threat to this species... At the end, I feel pretty good about my spiel. But Congresswoman Lowder votes no, and Allison Lowder cheers. What did I do wrong?! As we switch groups, Congresswoman Katherine Greer turns to me and says: you know why I voted no? Grumpily, I ask why. Because she he points to Lowder  went first. That night, in front of the mirror: My name is Anna Ho, and Im a constituent living in Cambridge. Im a senior at MIT majoring in physics, but today Im here representing the American Astronomical Society. In the fall, Im going to start a PhD program in astronomy.  Here is my contact information. If I can be a resource for you, please dont hesitate to contact me.  * * * On Monday, the talks were about science advocacy in general; today, the focus is on astronomy. Its Tuesday, all fifteen of us are finally here, and were sitting in a conference room at American Astronomical Society headquarters. At 9am, the Executive Officer gives us a warm welcome before leaving to go sign checks or something (he makes us laugh at 9am, which is no mean feat). For the next three hours, the AAS Director of Public Policy joins forces with Josh to bring us up to speed. They review terminology from yesterday, this time highlighting particular authorization bills that directly affect our field. They fill us in on current astronomy policy issues, most of which involve the National Science Foundation. Themes from yesterday resurface: your primary currency is your credibility, if you prove to be a useful resource people will come back to you, your face and your personal story alone are worth the visit. I take notes as usual but am a little distracted by the thought that woah, the AAS Director of Public Policy is sitting next to me. I snap out of my reverie when someone down the table asks what to do if were asked about the NSF Portfolio Review. Asked about the what?! The response is that if we get asked about the NSF Portfolio Review, we are to go out and have a beer to celebrate that someone up on Capitol Hill actually knows what the NSF is. If we get tough but informed questions, thats a reason to celebrate. At this point, the Associate Vice President for Research at the University of Alabama in Huntsville chimes in to remind us that our job is to promote our field, not to bash other fields or other organizations. I dont think it ever benefits anybody, he says, to speak from the perspective of negativity. Much more effective to present a united front, instead of bickering amongst ourselves while the politicians go deal with other issues. After lunch, we travel to the headquarters of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS). We sit through a series of talks. The highlight is a Q&A with staffers: Sean Gallagher from Congressman Rush Holts office is particularly enthusiastic and articulate. Were a filter for our boss, he tells us, but we tend to be a mile wide and an inch deep. You are our educators. Takeaways include: Suddenly, I realize what information I can uniquely provide during my meetings. I pull out my notebook to scribble down the first draft of my message. * * * Its Tuesday night and Im lying on my stomach in my hotel room bed. Tomorrow morning, I will lead meetings with staffers from two Massachusetts offices: Representative Michael Capuanos office and Senator Ed Markeys office. Im frantically reviewing. Michael Capuano. Very passionate about higher education. Makes sense, considering that the 7th congressional district has over a dozen research institutes, universities (including MIT and Harvard) and teaching hospitals. 1/5 of Nobel Prize winners have lived, studied, or worked in this district. Capuano has a lot to be proud of. Capuanos staffer: Andrew Eaton. BA in Political Science from U. Conn. Portfolio includes: budget, tax, social security, education, science, welfare, US Postal Service. Ed Markey. Already supportive of expanding investment in science research programs. This meeting can probably be short. Markeys staffer: Dan Pomeroy. PhD in High Energy Experimental Physics, has worked at the Large Hadron Collider. This meeting can definitely be short. My name is Anna Ho, and Im a constituent living in Cambridge. Im a senior at MIT majoring in physics, but today Im here representing the American Astronomical Society. In the fall, Im going to start a PhD program in astronomy, but when I started college I didnt think that I was cut out to be a research scientist. The summer after my sophomore year, I did an internship funded by the National Science Foundation. I loved it so much that I went back the next summer and did it again. I learned that I wanted to do research because I had the opportunity to try doing research. And I had that opportunity because of this program. I became a scientist because of this program.  I set my alarm for 6am and dream about sleeping through meetings. - Part 2 to follow -   Im fast asleep, probably snoring lightly and elegantly. My bodys shut down. Why, you ask? Why, you really ask? Why not? Ive just had all my rights violated by the Massassassachisetts Institvte of Technology and the Arts, passing through a 3-midterm, 1-pset, 1-mini-paper week. Its finally the weekenda four-day weekend at thatbut MIT has another thing coming if it thinks giving me four days off will be sufficient bribe to calm my fiery sense of injustice.  So Im probably just having some meandering, semi-psychopathic dream that will no doubt trudge its way into the dreary stew of words Ill call a story when my alarm goes off. The stupid thing begins blaring and blaring and oh please shut up! Anyway, I manage to rise and after mumbling a couple of sleepy words no doubt filled with infinite wisdom, I realize that its nearly five p.m.  I mumble an expletive I cant use on this blog, because cats read it or something and they lose a life for each such word. Im supposed to meet up with my advisor. Its Saturday, and he has a nice outing planned. Its one of those things where MIT tries to compensate for beating the crap out of everyone by offering nice dinners, and I was actually looking forward to eating something that couldnt crawl out of my plate or didnt seem to be having heart palpitations (yes, this is a not-even-slightly-veiled reference to the varied assortments of muck and dredge Maseeh Dining serves). Cue to me walking down Mass Ave, where Bostons accursed weather is actually kind of nice for once. Maybe too nice. Im suspicious, but I can wear a T-Shirt and thats fine. Im supposed to meet up my advisor, Saif Rayyan, in his car, with his wife and some of my classmates from Concourse. After a few minutes of texting and jaywalking and all manner of things that form the basis of Youtube ads, I finally lumber past the lumbering Stata Center (and can we please just talk about Stata! Its like concrete someone chewed, swallowed and regurgitated. What gives?!). And there he is! I tumble into the backseat of his car, where my friend and classmate Ava waves ever so nicely at me. You rock, Ava. Saifs wife is in the front seat beside him. Next comes the question of where to eat. My brain is still mostly fried from sleep so I suggest somewhere in MIT. We also debate other places, like Legal Seafood, which is just a fancy place you willingly let steal your money. But when my advisor calls, we find that its been fully booked, and that the restaurant is unable to steal from us at this time. Thus, we head to Woodys instead, a nice, picturesque (yes, that is a pretentious word, stop judging me!) restaurant a walk away from the Boston University Theatre, where my advisor has bought play tickets for us. But to get to Woodys, we have to go through All That Is Wrong With Earth And Life that is the Boston traffic. This at least allows for decent chatter, where we talk about exams and home and the meaning of life. In Woodys, we need to decide what to eat. After much deliberation, we settle on the sole hallmark and signifier of Americas achievementsthe Pizza. We add all sorts of things to itmushrooms and onions and pineapples and a few things that should be made mandatory at every meal. I show initial concern about how much to get, but my advisor does his marvelous job and advises me to let MIT have it! Its on them after all. And so I descend into a travesty of near-gluttonous abandon, ordering all the things. This evening, crimes against the stomach are at an all time high, starring such villains as***3 20 oz. glasses of orange juice ***six or seven or nine slices of pizza; after a while, you lose track and the world around you just glows with the pepperoni hue of pizza-induced hallucinations ***creme brulee! Because why not? Though it came riddled with a bunch of fruits I could have done without. And before your glaring eyes furl up in mortified consternation and all such politically correct reactions, you should realize that I spent the past several hours, from before eating to the previous evening mostly sleeping, and had pretty much eaten nothing since then. That said, by the time I was done, my stomach had swelled to epic proportions, and I sat there feeling like Id eaten a couple of Santa Clauses. Hee. But mostly eww. But mostly hee. Wut? Anyway, with everyone else done eating as well, we rise as one and head to the Boston University Theatre. The weather is still nice, and nope, Im still not buying it. Somethings up. At the Theatre, we meet one more Concourse student, and Saifs wife retreats somewhere backstage. Shes a classical pianist and will be one of many contributing to the operas beautiful music. The opera by the way is titled Don Giovanni, and after the execrable atrocity that was Paranormal Activity (how did that drivel get so many sequels), Im confident that this will be much better. I struggle through a bunch of people all standing around and talking, and walk into the dimly lit theater where I take my seat. My advisor is two seats away and he seems happy. I remember some stories his wife told us of him falling asleep in some of the past operas and giggle. Hee. Soon enough, the curtains rise and we begin with a dramatic flashing of lights, red and blue and orange against a heavy musical backdrop of swelling piano notes and grand trumpeting. Pretty quickly into the opera, theres a murder. Some random old dude is stabbed. He sings and moans and sings as fake blood squirts out, and I know Im gonna enjoy this. Its a three-hour opera though, three hours, and Ill be honest. I had a few issues with the pacing of the story, but the songs were really enjoyable, the actors extremely talented and a lot of lines pretty funny. Don Giovanni is one heck of a Lady Magnet, maybe too much, and thats pretty adorable. When hes not, you know, running from girl to girl or proposing to a woman with her fiance just barely out of earshot. Hes a jerk, and thats the point. A funny, lovable jerk in his own right, but a jerk nonetheless. And you can tell somethings gonna happen, retribution-wise. Hell get beaten to death or stomped on or stabbed or shot orare you kidding me? Thats how you decide to do it? Large sounds and flames and him falling backwards and a crack of hell and well, okay, this was a fun show so Ill accept. After a pretty enjoyable time, the opera is over, and the curtain falls. We get to clap hard for all the actors and actresses, and I see something pretty interesting. I see Saif, my physics teacher and advisor, cheer for the actors, which is fine, but hes really cheering, with great energy and stuff, along the lines of: Wuuuuuuuu! Yeaaah! Wuuuu! Wuuu! Wuu! Wuuuuuuu! Wuuuuuuuuuuuuu! WUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU! Its really nice to see and Im having laughing fits all over the place, as we leave the Theatre and stumble out into The outside! And aha! I knew there was something most foul (I just watched an opera! I get to say things like most foul) about the weathers niceness. It was a trap. Now, its pretty cold and Im shivering like a Course 18 about to see their HASS grade. (P.S. Ive actually seen a Course 18 see his grade for a HASS class. It would seem they dont shiver so much as bite their lips all serious-like and mumble a good number of Hmms). Saif drives us back to our respective dorms and we bid him adieu. ***So all in all, it was a pretty nice day, and Im willing to concede that MIT does a nice job of trying to connect students and faculty whenever possible. I hear you all screaming cop-out, but Im typing this post on the heels of a fugue-like, barely conscious state (psets, programming, enough error messages from Python to scar me for several lifetimes, dont ask) so Ill just tell you to deal with it. And after things like the evening with my advisor, the doorway to sappy sentimentality opens up. A bunch of thoughts flash through my head. Exams and psets and friends and complaining. And I realize that yup, I absolutely love this place. See you guys on the other side. Other side of what, you ask? Good question.    I've mentioned in prior posts that my hall, Tetazoo, in East Campus is very involved in climbing and hiking and other wonderful adventures.  We traditionally have a camping trip each fall, but this year Kayla E. '15 and Becca G. '14 organized a last minute spring camping trip with 18 people out to Rumney, New Hampshire.  We were all extremely excited for this last minute opportunity to relax and have some fun climbing, hiking, and camping in the wilderness.  We split into four cars with three different agendas: I was a part of Car 3 with Jackie. We were all excited for the adventure, and drove up Sunday night to Rumney, New Hampshire, to camp outside of the MITOC (MIT Outdoors Club) Camelot Cabin.  I actually saw Cathie Y. '16 there on a different MITOC adventure! Once all 18 of us tetazoans (and some friends) set up camp, we gathered around the fire and roasted some marshmallows.  At one point, Cappie P. '13 stood up and informed us that there was a place in the woods nearby called the "Observatory," which was a small clearing of trees and an overturned canoe where you can sit and watch the stars.  Five of us went to follow him on a search for the overturned canoe.  We quickly found ourselves hiking around in circles, stepping on snow and rocks and the tiny river that ran through the lot.  Cappie left with Barbie D. '17 back to camp, and the rest of us went searching for the stars. We eventually found the overturned canoe, and the astrophotographer among us, NiBr '17, took some beautiful pictures of the sky. Finally, we started our hike back to camp.  However, we found ourselves lost in the woods late at night, and couldn't even find the campfire from where we were.  We trekked through the forest, and finally saw some lights - however, they were street lights, not cabin lights. The cabin was a small hike from where we parked our cars on the street, so we headed towards the lights.  Along the way, we found a mobile home, and the widest part of the river we possibly could have found in that area. We hopped along the stones in the rapidly flowing river, and we found our way to the street. We ended up two large lots away from where we had parked our cars, but eventually found our way back to the rest of our group, excited from the adventure we just had. We all woke up early the next morning, ate our bagels that we had brought for the trip, and got on our way to our separate adventures.  My group of Cars 3 and 4 decided to do a small hike with a pretty waterfall, known as Nancy Cascades. It was supposed to be a nice two hour hike, and we figured that we could stop at the top of the waterfalls to eat our lunch and relax for a bit, maybe even take a nap. The ride there was fun. Sadun '17 got on the wheel, and although he frightened us at times, it was a lot of fun and he kept trying to get us to play road games and sings songs about bears and things. We saw all sorts of great things along the way, including cows!   The thing is, we couldn't find the trail head. We had a map, but we didn't purchase the New Hampshire trail book ahead of time because we thought we didn't need it.  So we found a parking lot near the GPS coordinates on the website, and started walking in the direction we figured the trail head probably was.  The place we parked near had a trail head for Davis Path, which I was really excited for, but everyone else wanted to look for waterfalls. I also love waterfalls, so I followed.  Still, we found some nature!  We stopped to ask for directions - twice -  and finally found our way to the trail head!  It was an adventure getting there, that's for sure. It was all in good fun!  At least there was more nature!  Finally, we found a trail head, which supposedly led to the trail we needed to follow to get to Nancy Cascades.  We made our way up a mountain, excited for the adventure. However, in front of us was a trail filled with miles of snow. It made it a bit difficult to get around.    The snow was pretty bad, but we kept pushing forward. Eventually we made it to the actual Nancy Cascades trail, marked by some bloody red paint. We took turns posing with the painted rocks all around us.   And we found more nature!  But with the nature came a whole lot of terrible snow.  It really was quite awful trekking through the snow without snow gear.  There was about a foot-wide path of packed down snow, but if you stepped off the path or slid outside of that area you found yourself waist-deep in cold, wet snow. It was still a really pretty adventure, though.    It took us a lot longer than we thought to get anywhere because of the snow. Almost three hours into the hike, and we were unsure about if we were even halfway to the top! We finally decided to stop by a really pretty area by the river for lunch and to dry our socks and shoes for a bit in the sun. It was really nice out - almost in the 70s - yet we were surrounded by snow!  After our break, we continued on the path, which was a bit more clearly labeled now since it had some steep areas that were really icy, as well as some ledged areas which were a little scary.  Finally, we found a sign! It didn't tell us where we were though or how much further we had to go, but we did feel a bit better that at least we were on the right path.  Eventually, we set a time for ourselves to give up. We left for the hike around 10:30am-ish, and it was closing in on 2pm. After falling into and out of snow and starting to lose the feeling in our toes and legs, three of us decided to stop where we were at 1:50pm and wait there for the group, which would turn around at 2pm anyways. We told them to yell back at us if they find the cascades in the next ten minutes, and we waited.  We waited ten minutes and heard nothing. We waited ten more minutes. After waiting 25 minutes in the snow, we left them a note on tree bark.   As we started walking back, two more of our hiking friends ran to catch up to us.  They had done the same thing as us five minutes out, and had also given up on the three people ahead of us, but told us that they had heard that the three hikers at the head of the trail had finally found the Nancy Cascades! They said that it was beautiful, but not really worth us going back for it because it would take another half hour. So we all turned around, and with me at the head of the group, made our way out of Nancy Cascades, not so excited for the slippery slopes ahead of us.    After our really long, and at times painful, hike, we all got together and rested. I walked back to the car with my bare feet on the hot asphalt of the New Hampshire highway, and we went back to Rumney, New Hampshire, to meet up with the rest of our group. Six of us changed our minds about going hiking during the night, and we shuffled around cars until it worked out.  We warned the other cars about the snowy conditions they will encounter during the night, and headed home a day early. I was really happy to get home. It's nice to be away from the snow and back in my comfy bed.  And, as always, the cats were really happy to have some of us back.    How was your CPW? It was definitely one of my favorites. I had lots of fun meeting a you future froshies in person. Today I wanted to address some concerns about CPW by sharing my own experiences. Recently, I got into Reddit (bad idea at this time of semester), especially r/MIT. One post that hit close to home was titled "Did anyone here not enjoy CPW but still love MIT once they were actually a student?" A prefrosh talked about how he felt he wouldn't fit into the MIT community because, during CPW,  all the events were about "legos" and "foam swords" and other kiddie kid stuff for little kids. He went to the informative events, but found himself one of the few prefrosh there. It was really hard connecting with other prefrosh, as it seemed that they were all on board with doing kiddie things for fun but he didn't share those interests. Even though I personally had lots of fun during my CPW, that same thought always floated around in the back of my head. I felt I wouldn't fit in unless my idea of a fun time was playing Super Smash Bros until 5 am while stuffing my face with mashed potatoes. Like the prefrosh in that thread, I too was one of the few prefrosh to go to the more official and "mature" events. I was worried that people didn't share my interests. But, as it turns out, CPW was more of an indicator of the kinds of things you COULD do with friends if you wanted to, not the things you'd have to participate in if you want to have fun here. When I came to MIT in the fall, I met so many people that destroyed that kiddie stereotype. During CPW, everything was hectic and squeezed into four days. During orientation and rush week, I got to know people from so many backgrounds, all with different ideas for fun. I immediately got involved with my dorm, other student groups, and fraternity life. I met people who liked the things I liked doing, so I felt at home. But I also become friends with people who I would've never imagined being friends with. We try making CPW as best as we can, but nomatter what, it'll always be such a small window to the vastness of the types of people that make up MIT. Besides, if you think that all we do are kiddie things, then you are mistaken, just like I was. We do pretty manly stuff. You know what's really manly? Steak. You know what's even manlier? Steak at 1 am. You know what goes great with steak at 1 am? Milk shakes. Cue Steak and Shake, which was held at Phi Kappa Sigma every CPW night. After a long hard day of having fun, prefrosh came and relaxed, enjoying steak and shake while playing pool and talking to brothers and other prefrosh about anything and everything. On Saturday night, I stayed up with three prefrosh until 5 am, at which point we decided that we might as well continue staying awake to watch the sunrise. It always had such a chill atmosphere, and everyone had a great time.  But I wasn't at Phi Kappa Sigma enjoying the classic atmosphere the entire CPW. I also did nonsensical things with my friends, like watching them cover their faces with sugar by blowing into cups.  There was also a great performance by the MIT improv comedy troupe Roadkill Buffet. Super manly and mature? Maybe not, but who cares? It was funny. Let loose and have fun.  At MIT, no matter what your type is, there's always a group of people who share your interests. Maybe your type is playing with foam swords in a ball pit. Maybe your type is going to a classy business luncheon and networking with econ professors. Maybe your type is playing pool at 1 am with a refreshing milkshake in one hand and a juicy piece of steak in the other. Or maybe your type is doing all three. Whichever way, MIT is a great place where you'll meet some of the coolest people you'll know for the rest of your life. Plus, who wouldn't want to hang out with these AXO girls?

There are literally (literally!) a dozen blog posts I wish I could write for you right now but I cant, at least not for at least another week. I want to talk to you, especially since some of you need to decide whether or not to come to MIT and the rest of you might be bored. This is an open conversation. I will answer any (any!) question you ask as honestly as I would if I were the one asking.  second semester senior at MIT, majoring in computer science and molecular biology (6-7) and math (18) and minoring in writing (21W).

Scrolling through the original message, I saw a comment that "Dudamel is cool." So, even though I had no idea whether Dudamel was a music genre, an instrument, a song title, or a composer, I replied "I'm definitely down! :)" and reserved a ticket. A month later, Google Calendar told me that I should meet Ashley at MIT's Kresge Auditorium. The theater was PACKED (I thought: "wow! this Dudamel thing must be *very* cool!") but we squeezed and "sorry! excuse me!"d our way in. Flipping through my program, I learned very quickly that Dudamel is not a music genre. Dudamel is not an instrument, or a song title, or a composer. Dudamel is, according to the program bio, "Music Director of both the Simon Bolivar Symphony Orchestra of Venezuela and the Los Angeles Philharmonic, and the impact of his musical leadership is felt on four continents." His guest conducting appearances include the NY Philharmonic and the Munich Philharmonic. Feeling very uncultured, I went on to read that he was voted into the Gramophone Hall of Fame, has won a gazillion awards, is in the Royal Swedish Academy of Music, and was one of Time Magazine's 100 most influential people in 2009. Yep. Definitely not a musical instrument. I got a little bored of the laundry list of musical accolades, so it was refreshing - and a little surprising - to read that Harvard recently awarded him the Q Prize "for extraordinary service to children." I was equally surprised to look up and see small children sitting on stage: in the front row, there were 7- and 8-year-olds clutching miniature violins with their feet dangling above the ground. Turns out that the "concert" was actually an open rehearsal, as part of the Sistema Side by Side seminario series. A seminario is a tradition in Venezuela, where Dudamel is from. According to the program, a seminario is "a larger ensemble community." "Children from music programs in various neighborhoods and regions frequently come together...to make music together." This particular seminario was made up of: children from the Los Angeles Philharmonic Youth Orchestra (YOLA) who had flown across the country for this event + children from Massachusetts + conservatory students from the Longy School of Music of Bard College. The MA kids and the Longy students were paired up as part of a community program called Side By Side: they've been rehearsing together every weekend for the past year. They all wore matching black t-shirts that said SIDE BY SIDE in white letters. The timpani pair were particularly adorable; there was a little kid wearing a cast partnered up with a tall young man from Longy, and their height ratio was about 1:2. It was a very strange construction: the intimacy of a children's orchestral rehearsal up on stage in front of a gigantic audience, led by a famous conductor. The audience was packed with parents, sponsors, and random MIT community members who were on some mailing lists and might not have known a whole lot about what they were walking into. The man in front of me spent the entire rehearsal Facetiming on his iPhone with a woman who I presume was the mother of one of the young performers. Imagine what this meant for Dudamel himself: as my friend Davie '12 (who was also at the concert) put it, he had three different - not obviously reconcilable - tasks. He had to, as the conductor, run a functional and productive rehearsal. As a performer (and when a Kresge Auditorium-ful of people are watching you, you are performing whether you like it or not) he had to entertain. As the conductor of a performing children's orchestra, he had to make the children comfortable up there on the stage. Spoiler alert: he did all three, spectacularly. After an introduction that included a thank-you to Rafael Reif for providing space at MIT (WOOOOO! MIT!!!!!) Dudamel finally walked on stage. On his way from stage right to the podium, he shook hands with several of the children and beamed at everybody. When the auditorium fell silent, he asked one of the kid's in the front row: "it's too warm in here! is it okay if I take off my jacket?" I guess the kid gave Dudamel his blessing, because Dudamel took off his fancy jacket to reveal a black t-shirt and jeans. He eased himself onto a wooden stool and leaned his elbows on his knees. And just like that, the entire auditorium relaxed too. My first impression of Dudamel was: "Wow, Dudamel is adorably awkward." He stumbled over his words, mumbling that he didn't really know the music that well, actually he didn't know the music at all, and what were we even here to play again? Some little kid told him the answer. "Oh, okay," he said. "You guys will have to lead me, because I don't know the music." Ha! The orchestra were playing the Farandole from Bizet's L'Arlesienne Suite No. 2 and the Finale from Tchaikovsky's Symphony No. 5 in E Minor, and so of course Dudamel had both of those pieces totally committed to memory (not to mention he was 110% prepared for the rehearsal). But it was a trick to make the kids more comfortable with him, and it was endearing. He reminded me of Papageno, for those of you familiar with Mozart's Magic Flute -- he adopted a kind of charming woodland creature quality, perching on the edge of that stool. He occasionally shifted to look over his shoulder and quip to the audience. And then he lifted up his baton, and I realized that Dudamel isn't awkward at all; he's just expertly theatrical. Before long, he had left his stool and was standing up and Papageno was out of my mind; instead, I thought that Dudamel could be a dancer, the way he stood up straight and seemed to have complete control of every single movement. He also had the BEST similes. "These two phrases," he would say. "They are the same on paper, no? They are like twins. But twins - you are still different, a little bit. So we must play them differently." To describe a grand passage, a dancer's thumping long legs. To describe a passage of rapid notes, a dancer's short scuttling legs. He was really brilliant, and I wish I wrote more of these down, but I was too busy being totally captivated. At the end of the performance, Jamie Bernstein - Leonard Bernstein's daughter (WOAH! LEONARD BERNSTEIN'S DAUGHTER!) presented an award to Dudamel: the Leonard Bernstein Lifetime Achievement Award for the Elevation of Music in Society. "With this award," Jamie read aloud from the program, "Longy recognizes an artistic leader whose life has been dedicated to inspiring and enriching lives through music. The Bernstein laureate, whether as a performer or teacher" - and here she broke from the program and said "OR BOTH!" - "exemplifies how music can lift spirits, raise the level of culture in society, and transform lives." Dudamel said that he was part of the El Sistema family (the program in Venezuela that inspired Side by Side) and was receiving the award as part of that family and not as an individual. And then it was time to leave. Dudamel got the audience to give an extra gigantic round of applause for the little timpani player. "He's the best timpani player I have ever seen in an orchestra!" Dudamel announced. "Playing with one hand!" (the kid had a cast.) He gave the timpani player a hug, then turned outward and smiled at all of us. "I am becoming an old man," he said. "Because, when you feel like a father, you are becoming an old man." He left the stage, and the parents in the audience rushed up to be with their kids.   On Sunday morning the Design/Build/Fly team rolled out of bed at 6:30 AM, roughed up and ready to fly on the last day of the competition. We had one more mission to fly and we wanted to re-fly a mission as well in order to score a little higher. We were on the clock--the weather forecasted heavy rain and a thunderstorm starting around noon, in which case the competition would go on hold and awards would be given based on the current scores. The last mission was the emergency medical mission: the assignment was to carry a two-pound payload (distributed between four blocks arranged to simulate medical attendants standing next to patients on gurneys) for three laps around the course in as short a time as possible. We knew that our Corn Dog was the fastest plane at the competition--however, the heavy winds of Saturday showed no signs of dying down, and Corn Dog was a little worse for wear after yesterday's heavy flying. The time to beat was 1 minute and 55 seconds. Corn Dog's turn came while the sun was still out, and we quickly moved outside, packed the cargo into the payload bay, and got ready to fly.   Loading up. Corn Dog took off smoothly into the wind, turned around, and completed two and a half laps with no problems at all. As it came around the final turn to approach the finish line, a collective gasp went up from the crowd (along with fearful yelps and held breaths from we the team members) as Corn Dog yelped a loud SNAP and began making the very unhealthy-sounding buzzing sound of an electric razor. Corn Dog dipped out of the air--then fluttered back up again--then dipped again and charged forward through the finish line with a final time of 1 minute and 49 seconds. Success! But Corn Dog was still in the air, still buzzing loudly, and stumbling around looking like it had broken a leg. As we held our breaths and crossed our fingers, Adam (our pilot) turned Corn Dog around and landed it intact on the pavement.   Coming in literally on a wing and a prayer. Cue sighs of relief and thunderous applause.  Adam (who we are forever and ever indebted to for his amazing flying, and who has also guest-blogged for MITAdmissions), told us that he'd lost control of one of the ailerons (so Corn Dog was indeed a crippled dog for the last 100 feet or so of the flight). Examining the plane revealed that that aileron had undergone flutter, where it essentially resonates with the air going over it and vibrates wildly out of control. For Corn Dog, this meant that a lot of Bad Forces were exerted on the wing--and our beautiful composite wing layup buckled pretty badly. See those wrinkles? Those are caused by the Bad Forces put on the wing by the aileron flutter. As the more experienced members of the team set about the very delicate task of repairing and reinforcing our wing in anticipation of reflying our last mission and shaving a few more seconds off our time, the rest of us found lunch at Chipotle and then camped the scoreboard for updates. Eventually it refreshed, and there we were--with our punishing weight of 4.66 pounds balanced out by our excellent mission score (in fact, the highest mission score), we sat at a solid fifth place, ten points ahead of Penn State. Performing surgery on Corn Dog. We attempted a reflight later that afternoon, but our wing couldn't take it--as soon as we finished one lap, that uncomfortable buzzing sound returned and Adam quickly turned Corn Dog around and landed it before it exploded in flight. This time it was the other aileron that failed. We called it a wrap and spent the rest of the afternoon huddling in the wind and watching the other teams fly (and in many cases, crash) their planes between spats of rain and thunder. We're very happy with our fifth-place finish, but we also took home a few lessons from the competition. Predominant is the fact that, though Corn Dog was designed well and constructed beautifully, it was way too heavy--and therefore lost out to lighter planes that didn't perform as well on the missions. Corn Dog was a very structurally solid plane (hence why it's still in one piece), but that meant that Corn Dog was conservative. Planes that pushed the envelope a little more, using less power and less structure and flying a little less stably, gained more from the decreased weight than they lost in performance. The University of Southern California, for instance, had a mission score only 80 percent of ours--but since their plane was less than half the weight of Corn Dog, and mission score is divided by weight, USC finished with in first place with a whopping 407.24 while we settled in fifth with a meager 210.87. And so we packed up Corn Dog and came home to MIT. We're going to be bringing our A-game next year, though--so be prepared. Corn Dog, Jr. is on its way. For now, if you're ever in building 33, stop by the hangar and pay a visit to Corn Dog, one of the sexiest RC planes to ever fly the Kansas winds.

Today was the major flight day for most of the teams at the Design/Build/Fly competition, and as hats flew and hair rippled in 30+ mph wind, it became clear that Wichita was dead-set on making sure flight was as difficult as possible. We wanted our plane, Corn Dog, to fly all three of our missions today--two speed missions and one untimed cargo mission--so that we would have an opportunity to re-fly tomorrow for better scores. However, when we arrived to the competition site, a brisk wind decided to settle in and loiter in the airfield for a day or two. Let's be clear--wind is bad for model planes. Wind means turbulence, extra drag, and a significantly decreased groundspeed when flying upstream. For instance, if your plane is designed to fly at 20 mph and the wind is 30 mph, your plane will take off and actually "fly" backwards.  The flight course Fortunately, Corn Dog was built for a cruising airspeed of about 70 mph, but it still took the extraordinary skill of our pilot, Adam (MIT alum and very experienced DBFer) to fly without crashing. We completed our first speed mission with a score of 7 laps in 4 minutes (tying with the best score), and we were only a few extra seconds short from setting the high score at 8 laps. When it was our turn to fly again, we flew the untimed cargo mission, carrying a three-pound payload for three laps. Unfortunately, the flight rotation didn't allow us to fly our third mission, so we'll be doing that tomorrow morning (and praying that the wind will take the morning off). Corn Dog on the move. Corn Dog weighed in on the heavy side at 4.66 pounds empty. Our extra weight nevertheless meant that we were one of the most stable planes at the competition; we spent all afternon between our flights watching plane after plane flip, crash, snap, or explode after being attacked by vicious winds at inopportune moments. One plane, for instance, ran out of power midair and came in for a glider landing--except the wind picked up right before touchdown, and the plane flipped over and shredded itself against the ground. Another plane got carried off-course by the wind and appeared to lose connection with the receiver, diving explosively into the lawn to the sound of a collective grimace from the crowd. At the end of the day, however, score is divided by aircraft weight--and as the live scoreboard updated throughout the day, we found our score trailing behind those of planes with net weights around 2 pounds. For comparison, Corn Dog's battery pack alone weighs 1.5 pounds. Here are the weights of the top three airplanes at the end of today: University of California, Irvine: 2.86 lbs San Jose State University: 2.04 lbs University of Southern California: 1.88 lbs Despite having the same mission scores as these teams, Corn Dog had over twice the weight, so we checked in at 13th place (that's with the zero score for the mission we didn't get to fly yet). Since Corn Dog is so fast, we're anticipating doing awesome on the third mission, and hoping to have enough time to refly our first mission and bump our score up to 8 or maybe even 9 laps. Given our weight, we're shooting for somewhere in the vicinity of a respectable fifth-place finish. Wish us luck and favorable weather :)  Corn Dog in flight, heading upwind. Overall, we're very happy with our performance--and other teams are noticing how beautiful Corn Dog is, too. DBF really fosters a super-friendly atmosphere, and we got into a lot of long conversations with other teams about our construction process. We were one of the few teams to build our plane pretty much entirely out of composites (big thanks to our sponsors and to the wellspring of resources that is MIT AeroAstro)--most of the other planes were made out of monokote (which is sort of like plastic saran wrap, but sturdier) stretched over balsa wood skeletons. Some common questions we got: What's the fuselage made out of? Three layers of Kevlar.  Was it expensive? Very. What are the wings made of? Two skins made of insulation foam and laid up with carbon fiber and fiberglass, then joined together sandwiched around a carbon/foam-core spar. It makes for a nice sky-blue wing that clashes wonderfully with the mustard color of the Kevlar fuselage. How did you steer the plane in the taxi mission? We have two propellers, so differential thrusting gave us plenty of turn control. How heavy is it? Too heavy. 4.66 pounds. (Usually elicited a sympathetic nod and something along the lines of "Yeah...weight tends to creep up on you unexpectedly.") Can we touch it? No. Final note: I'd like to give a shoutout to the team from USC, who had all their female members in hot pink shirts with TEAM GIRL on them. It's a great way to call attention to sexism in STEM and at least put that awareness in people's minds. Not to mention it looked fabulous--I'm beginning a campaign to put the entire MIT team, male and female, in hot pink My Little Pony-themed tank tops for next year's competition. Rainbow Dash would be proud. Corn Dog is cute, and so are we. --Allan I am sitting in the coolest little corner of our courtyard I've ever seen wearing shorts and a tank top.  The temperature is well into the sixties, and the music is blasting from the EC speakers sending a beacon out to prefrosh, welcoming them to our home. This is CPW. I already wrote a pre-CPW post, and this is my CPW update, informing you all about how incredible this experience is, and how grateful I am to live in a place this awesome. I woke up early this morning, 8am, for EMS drills, and although I was tired, I don't regret a second of it.  I love learning more about how I can help people, and I've had so many great ideas about how to spread our help across campus. More on that some other time, it's CPW! CPW has included so many different events, from tree swinging to cat petting to shanti-town building and more!  Here are some pictures of our adventures!      	And as promised, there was a Tim hack!!  Tim the beaver got to play the role of Miley Cyrus this weekend, on a wrecking ball!   	The prefrosh were very excited, but Galileo was not impressed, as usual.  	In other news, like I mentioned in my last post, the theme for East Campus' CPW this year is "The Great Depression." On Thursday we celebrated the Roaring Twenties with food and rich things, and then on Friday the prefrosh smashed a sign labeled "Stock Market" with sledge hammers.  After that, they built a giant box fort from the ruins of the stock market crash. It was beautiful. I am sitting inside of it right now! I hope we can keep it.     	When I was not occupying the fort, Fuzzy W. '14 was Trader Jack, handing out candy and other goodies to prefrosh and upperclassmen who answered his unusual questions correctly.  	As usual, the grills were fired up and ready to hand hundreds of prefrosh and MIT students burgers, as well as dye their hair!  	Every Friday at 5pm, East Campus has a tradition called Friday Afternoon Club, or FAC. Each week, a new hall is responsible for providing some sort of food substance for our dorm, and serving it in the dormitory lounge, Talbot.  Each year during CPW, Putz, or second west, is responsible for doing the infamous "CryoFAC," where they make liquid nitrogen ice cream for us and all the preforsh. It was awesome!   	While this was all happening, our campus was infiltrated by the enemy! Caltech students appeared on campus in a crowd - and we greeted them with ice cream and happiness!  They were sponsored by Caltech alumni to fly out here during our CPW to pull a very creative hack - they set up stations around campus and handed out mugs that normally looked like plain MIT mugs, but when heated they said "Caltech - the Hotter Institute of Technology." We were very impressed by this, and I personally gave them a tour of East Campus! They loved our culture and cats, and hopefully next year we can go visit them during their prefrosh weekend and mess with them in a similar way! It was really fun hanging out with them, and they even gave me a mug as a thank you for giving them a tour! Thanks Caltech!    	Caltech even got to go cruft smashing!  	Our freshmen even created some fun CPW events for everyone on the fly, such as tube races/battles/funtime.  	Meanwhile, inside talbot...   	At the end of the night, some of my friends and I ventured over the Spring Greater Boston Invitational Songfest, where all of MIT's awesome a cappella groups sang their hearts out! It was incredible and hilarious and so much fun to watch! 10-250 was filled to the brim with prefrosh, parents, and excited MIT students!  Here are some of my blurry pictures of the event. BUT! Fun fact! I'm buying a real-person camera soon, so no more blurry phone pictures! Hopefully by my next blog post, all my pictures will be beautiful, instead of only the ones containing cats!    	After a cappela, I walked home among the crazy prefrosh, excited for a night full of excitement, and of course, the Meet the Bloggers event! The event went lovely - the room was filled with bloggers, Petey, pie, coconut water, and lots of excited prefrosh! I even got a really cool Blogger shirt with my avatar on it! It was a little strange at first, but we quickly went into conversations about CPW, life at MIT, dorm culture, and more!  I even gave a bunch of them some tasty tangerines at the end! 	CPW is awesome. Everything is awesome right now at MIT, even if we have tons of work next week and this past week.  Seeing excited prefrosh brings all us students extreme joy and excitement about this awesome place we live and study in.  We hack, we punt, we tool - we live, we breathe, we MIT. And sharing this with prefrosh is so amazing, it really is hard to put into words. 	Each night, my prefrosh, Molly, and I have passed out, exhausted from the day but excited about the future and happy about where we are and where we will be. 	As usual, here is a picture of Galileo to end this post with. He is also extremely exhausted from all the excited prefrosh who have come to visit him!  	This is East Campus, this is MIT. This undescribable feeling is home :) Remember, kids, consent is sexy--so ask for permission before touching somebody else's airplane. This is important when you have 80 teams and their airplanes stuffed into a single Cessna hangar. There's the same sort of packed, nervous atmosphere that a hackathon has, but with airplanes. One-propeller airplanes and two-propeller airplanes. Big, long, tubular airplanes and boxy nugget-shaped airplanes. Airplanes with two fuselages and airplanes with two tails. See-through airplanes and colorful checkerboard airplanes. One airplane even had a shining coat of red-velvet glitter paint.   With the airplanes come airplane geeks. As everyone paraded their airplane into the hangar, it was common to overhear good-natured conversations about preferred manufacturing processes, questions about materials, and compliments about everything from the landing gear design to the paint job. Sometimes people get enthusiastic and want to touch each others' airplanes. This is kind of uncomfortable for everyone involved--imagine if you spent six months carefully crafting the perfect airplane and someone puts their grubby hands all over it. Not cool, especially for an airplane as special as our Corn Dog (so named for its Kevlar-yellow fuselage).  We're in Kansas for the Design/Build/Fly competition, and after unpacking our mobile laboratory and assembling our plane last night, we caught a few hours of sleep and crawled out of bed this morning at 6 AM. One group loaded up suitcases and headed off to the competition site, while the other took our airplane out to an RC field for some last-minute flight testing.   At the competition site, every team was given a taped-off area about 7 feet square to set up shop. While we unpacked all our suitcases and toolboxes, the teams around us sneaked awkward glances at our area and our conspicuous lack of an airplane. "The MIT team looks like they're all freshmen," muttered one of our neighbors. Meanwhile, we muttered to each other about the demographic makeup of the competition. "I forgot how much of a sausagefest DBF is," said one of our upperclassmen. "I think we're the only team that has more girls than guys." She had a point--the MIT team is in the extreme minority, if not unique, for having a female captain, and we were also one of the few teams not comprised largely of white males. Nevertheless, there was still a fair amount of diversity; one of our neighbors was a good-natured team from Tel Aviv that we quickly befriended, and across the room, a team from Hong Kong and a team from the United Arab Emirates hung their flags next to each other on the wall.    Meanwhile, our flight testing team had discovered that our airplane's center of gravity was too far forward. This meant delays. The first part of the competition is a "tech inspection," where the airplane is inspected on the ground to make sure everything is built to specifications and won't explode on takeoff. We were nineteenth in line, and as team 17 was called our flight testing team finally arrived with our plane. We ran into the parking lot to finish final assembly and march our plane into the hangar just in time for tech inspection. Final assembly in the parking lot   Tech inspection entailed a detailed checklist for our plane electronics, checking that the payload fit into the payload bay (left), and testing the radio connection and controls (right). After a nerve-wracking twenty minutes, we ticked all the boxes and carried Corn Dog lovingly to our workspace. We then headed out to Sonic (a drive-in burger restaurant) for lunch, where I ate a chicken sandwich and possibly the best limeade I've ever had in my life.   When we returned to the competition, it was time for Corn Dog's first test: the taxi mission. The airplane had to taxi (roll without taking off) across forty feet of corrugated roofing surface, and we watched nervously to see if our landing gear was up for the job.     Corn Dog, being the amazing plane we built it to be, passed the taxi mission with flying colors (or rather, rolling colors), and we headed back into the hangar for some more tune-ups and adjustments in anticipation of our first flight mission. Unfortunately we ran into some difficulties with our electronics and decided we weren't ready to fly today, so tomorrow (Saturday) we'll hopefully be flying all three of our flight missions. We fixed our bugs, headed to Olive Garden for a well-deserved dinner, and then called it a night.  Stay tuned for more pictures of Corn Dog (in flight!) and reports of our competition progress. Wish us luck for our flight missions tomorrow, that we may bring glory to the Institvte :) Allan We're in a hotel room and we're watching Men In Black (preceded by Aviator and Family Guy) while assembling our airplane to drown out the raucous men out in the parking lot blasting loud country music.  While all you sprightly prefrosh came rushing into MIT for the one and only Campus Preview Weekend, the MIT Design/Build/Fly (DBF) team was in lab, packing up and headed out to Wichita, Kansas for the 18th Annual AIAA DBF competition. Our plane, having been shipped last week in a big wooden crate carefully lined with soft things and packing foam, was waiting for us.    (You'd be surprised how many people want to lick our airplane. It's pretty sexy.) What, you might ask, is DBF? DBF is exactly what its name sounds like--a team of students designs, builds, and flies a remote-control aircraft to fulfill a number of mission requirements, and do it better and faster than all the other teams. It's about as hands-on as aerospace engineering gets, from the initial design brainstorming to the hours of mixing epoxy and building composites out of kevlar, carbon fiber, and insulation foam. This year, the design theme is "backcountry rough field bush plane." The plane simulates a medical plane for carrying cargo (1-pound 6-inch cubes) as well as a combination of four blocks simulating medical attendants standing next to patients on gurneys. The plane also has to be able to taxi for 40 feet on corrugated roofing. The theme is different every year--two years ago, the mission requirement was to carry 2 liters of water to a 100-meter altitude and then dump it out of the airplane like an aerial firefighter.  The MIT DBF team works out of the Gelb Lab in the basement of Building 33 (take a tour if you're on campus!). It's decked out with all your standard machining machines (mills, lathes, a waterjet), as well as two wire cutters for cutting insulation foam and one CNC foam cutter for more finicky foamcutting. DBF has a closet full of rolls of kevlar, carbon fiber of all different weaves and weights, bottles of epoxy and rolls of adhesives, plus all sorts of other knicknacks, tools, and materials needed to build and fly airplanes. Molds for our fuselage, wings, and tails. Vacuum pumps for composite layups. Motors and propellers and electronics galore.  If the MIT DBF team goes to Kansas, though, we take our lab with us. As of 6:00 AM this morning, the Gelb Lab has gone mobile. We've packed pretty much all our tools (sanding bars, drills, dremels, soldering irons, razor blades, etc) into our check-in luggage and our carry-ons, as well as enough backup parts and materials to rebuild our airplane three times over in case it spontaneously combusts or lawn-darts into the ground. Here we are waiting for the subway:  The TSA probably had a lot of fun going through our bags of chemicals, batteries, and cutting implements. When we arrived in Kansas a subway ride, two airplanes, and a layover in Chicago later, I realized that I'd forgotten it was possible for the weather to be over 50 degrees. It's a simmering 70 degrees here--t-shirts and shorts and even sunscreen--and no signs of changing much over the weekend, either. It's hot, hot, hot. We loaded up our suitcases into rental cars and drove over to our hotel, a sunny Days Inn by the highway, where we picked up our finished airplane and lovingly uncrated it from its wooden womb.    We then promptly unpacked our laboratory from our suitcases and set up shop. We had an airplane to assemble. The bathroom turned into a dremeling station (and soon became appropriately covered in blue foam dust), while the beds were repurposed as lab tables.       We'll be up early tomorrow morning to flight-test our baby once its fully assembled.  Stay tuned--because I'll be liveblogging on our progress every day this weekend to keep y'all posted about how awesome our airplane is. I'll be publishing some flight pictures of the plane very very soon :)  With love from Kansas, Allan When people ask me where I grew up, I hesitate for a moment before saying Orange County, California. I was born in Kalamazoo, Michigan, but I moved before the memory making parts of my brain could actually store any reliable information. I have one memory of me crying in the kitchen while my parents try to feed me coconuts, but this is of questionable veracity. My family then relocated to Carmel, Indiana, a city just north of Indianapolis where I spent my days eating Steak n Shake and fishing in the lake by our house. Is it important to this story that I tell you my neighbor Ed used to be a professional clown? Absolutely not. But now you can say that you know someone who had a clown for a neighbor. You know, if that ever comes up in conversation or something. While some might say that I spent my formative years in Orange County, Id like to think that the years leading up to my second grade move to California played no small role in getting me to where I am today. At the very least, it was the source of quite a few memorable experiences, and even some seemingly unmemorable experiences that have somehow managed to weasel their way into my permanent memory. This spring break, I went to Chicago with my family for a weekend. As we drove to our hotel, I looked out the window and watched as miscellaneous shrubbery and nondescript store fronts whizzed by. We were in a new city, and there were a hundred different places we could have gone first: the Sears Tower, Wrigley Field, or even the Shedd Aquarium. Noticeably absent on this list was Meijer, the local mid-west grocery store and the very first stop in our weekend vacation. I had been the one to suggest a stop at the grocery store I remembered so fondly from my childhood in Indiana. Not because I had a strange affinity for produce and breakfast cereals, but because of something I like to call The Lobster Incident. The Lobster Incident, my friends, begins with Young Krystals fascination with the massive lobster tank in the seafood section of Meijer. She particularly enjoyed watching the armored crustaceans frolic in the bubbling waters, so one fine day, she begged her parents to let her stare at the lobsters. Having gotten her wish, she proceeded to smush her face against the glass and ooh and ahh at the marvelous creatures. Of course, as we all know now, lobsters in seafood tanks are the opposite of interesting. With the poor animals on the brink of death, present day me doesnt find their lack of liveliness surprising. This revelation soon dawned upon Young Krystal and she realized that seafood lobsters were not, in fact, the most riveting attraction at Meijer. So, bored and brazen, she wandered off into the wilderness of the supermarket, intent on seeing the sights and discovering uncharted aisles filled with exotic goods. Young Krystal had gone where no Young Krystal had ever gone before and soon found herself lost in the aisle of disposable cutlery and dinnerware, her parents nowhere to be found. To make a long story short, a store employee found Young Krystal, probably bawling in a corner somewhere, and had to call her parents over the store intercom. The present day me now stood in front of the lobster tank in the Chicago Meijer, wondering how on earth I had ever thought a handful of motionless lobsters, claws clamped shut by rubber bands, were interesting. Recalling memories and reliving memories are two entirely different things. Before, every time I thought about The Lobster Incident, I remembered with fondness how awesome the lobsters were, how scary and confusing the winding aisles were, and how foreign shelves of cutlery could really seem. More than ten years later, I stare at the lobsters and think: Wow, Id rather watch a potato grow mold. I peruse the aisles and realize how straight and organized they are. I gaze upon foreign shelves of cutlery and  well actually I dont usually gaze upon foreign shelves of cutlery. Thatd be weird. I wonder why I remember so clearly the lobsters laying still at the bottom of the tank, or the rows upon rows of paper and plastic plates, but I have no clear memory of crying, of being escorted away by an employee, or of what must have been a joyous reunion with my concerned parents, arguably the most traumatic parts of the story. The most important parts are a blur but the strangest details remain. We dont get to choose what moments we forget, and which we get to keep. Even those that are stored in some nook or cranny in our memories arent always the same when we revisit them in real life. Campus Preview Weekend for me was a chance to create a real first impression of an institute that I could potentially spend the next four years of my life at. I hadnt committed yet and was still torn between MIT and another school. The funny thing is I cant seem to recall much from the four day weekend extravaganza. Like The Lobster Incident, there are moments that I remember clearly, and those that seem to have faded away. There was the overwhelming bustle of the activities midway, during which I was amazed at the numerous student groups manning booths and trying to interest pre-frosh in the extracurricular side of MIT. There was liquid nitrogen ice cream in the evening outside of the Z-center, current students clad in protective rubber equipment and swirling clouds of white being stirred up by our shuffling footsteps. There was learning how to use an electric drill for the first time in East Campus as rotating troupes of pre-frosh and East Campus residents pitched in to build a tree-house-fort-thing that was pretty darn awesome. Not everything at CPW is directly related with getting to know the campus, culture, and people better; some of it really is just for the fun of it. But its a great opportunity to experience things in person and make impressions that will hopefully encourage you to join us here at MIT. For those of you who havent made a decision yet, Id encourage you to go out of your way to form a concrete impression. Dont make my mistake and cruise through CPW without paying any attention. I let things happen however they may and I dont think I got the most out of CPW. While it certainly is a weekend to have fun, its also a time preview the campus and for some, facilitate an important decision. Weeks afterwards, I was still agonizing over my decision and my memories were already fading. If academics are at the crux of your decision, go to some classes tomorrow, and ask the students here about classwork, psets, professors and anything you can think of; we are more than happy to answer your questions! If you like sports, make sure you check out the Z-center and go to the athletics fair where you can talk with coaches or other student-athletes. Youre going to have fun no matter what. So many people have put their time and effort into making CPW the awesome event it is every year. But if I could go back and change one thing about my CPW, I would have talked to more people and asked more questions (although eating more liquid nitrogen ice cream would be a close second). Theres only so much you can get out of reading brochures and eating free food. Reliving the few memories now that I made at CPW is like reliving The Lobster Incident again over spring break. A new perspective has changed the way I view things. While Pre-frosh Krystal at CPW was intimidated by the sheer magnitude and energy of MITs campus, Present Day Krystal doesnt think its so scary anymore. Despite all of the pset horror stories and exam day nightmares that I remember being casually tossed around during CPW, its actually pretty awesome here. Ive had time to come to terms with the ups and downs of college life so now the winding hallways dont seem so hopeless, the strangers milling around dont seem so distant and unapproachable, and the classrooms and professors dont seem so daunting. Have fun. Eat food. Be awesome. By the end of this weekend, youll have a bucketful of memories to share with everyone, all hopefully more interesting than a bunch of lobsters sitting around waiting to get eaten.  I cant believe its been a year since I first delved into the MIT campus for a 3-day Campus Preview Weekend.  Suffice it to say that those three days felt like the longest three days of my life. My total sleep count over that weekend was in the single digits and I still remember a lot. My adrenaline was at an all-time high, fueled by the Institue's atmosphere of absolute energy. I remember a large bouncy castle and upperclassmen being dunked in water. I remember hugging Tim the Beaver and pulling my first all-nighter talking to amazing people. I remember my host, who hugged me on sight, and I remember the utter feeling of overwhelming joy as I treaded this new and strange and exciting environment. I remember a cool robot demonstration and I remember more liquid nitrogen ice-cream events than I really should! But despite how much of MIT I soaked in, I only covered a pinprick of what was in store for us. And to everyone whos going to be here over the next few days for CPW, I can promise you that getting pulled into its amazing pulse will be almost effortless. It takes a life of its own, and kind of sucks you in. But youll also need to be proactive. I found meticulously planning what events to attend particularly unhelpful, because I realized that just taking a bunch of steps in some random direction led me to some new place with some ongoing event far more exciting than what I had originally planned. That said, do go through your CPW booklet, which should contain literally dozens of pages of events spread out over 3-4 days! Find events that get you super-excited and go see them, but dont overplan. CPW was one of the most memorable weekends of my life, so much so in fact, that for the rest of this week, I am no longer Vincent Anioke, MIT Freshman. I am now Jason Hernaka, bespectacled, clueless prefrosh from Uganda, and Ill try to see how many prefrosh events I can sneak my way into, before my cover is blown and Im kicked out in some barrel. And now I present some wonderful advice (from wonderful current students at MIT) about CPW, as well the events going on in my dorm, Random Hall! There are tons of exciting ones so come check us out, and worry not if you get lost. The brave soldiers of Random have drawn paths leading from the Student Center to the abode that is Random Hall. Beyond our mystic doors, you will find the Ancients, sage-eyed and grinning, their arms stretched, to welcome you into a new and exciting world. --- Katie B. '15 1. If you pay for food at any point, you're doing it wrong.2. If you're asking yourself, "Should I go to Thing X?" the answer is always yes. Events > sleeping.3. Try things you've never done before, and try things you're not sure you'll like; MIT is all about new experiences! Elizabeth K. '14Dont stress over not being able to do everything. Its a life skill youll have to get used to if you come to MIT. :)Also, dont forget to sleep, as much as people pressure you to do ALL THE THINGS. Sleep is important. Rebecca L. '17I didn't know housing lottery was a thing and hence paid zero attention to dorms. This is a bad idea. Pay some attention to which dorm you like, so you can think about where you might want to lottery. At the same time, don't worry a ton about it because fyre and rex. Kate T. '16Check out ALL the dorms! Even if you fall in love with one and all you want to do is spend ALL your time there, you need to keep your options open. If you do end up in your first choice, you'll have a better idea of what your other friends' living groups are like. If you don't get into your first choice dorm, you'll know what other dorms would be a good fit for you and where you would be happy your first semester (if not your entire time at MIT) :) Katie S. '17Thoroughly look over all the events in advance. Schedule your CPW time, but be flexible. Also, get your parents to go to boring but informative events, and go to the fun ones instead. Try make it to a lot of the different dorms and get tours (this will be much better than trying to figure out which dorm you want later, with just the online information). Also, really talk to the people who live in each dorm about what it's like. Also, even if you're not planning on living in an east side dorm, you should visit them to see some of the awesome murals they have. Andrea L. '14Have fun!Try to think about if you want to be like people you are meeting in 2 or 4 years. The people you surround yourself with shape who you become. --- Meanwhile, brewing at Random Hall... Feel the magic this weekend. AHHH CPW!!! Was the name of my last blog post I wrote prior to CPW last year, and it is, once again, that time of year! This year I'd like to make it Q&A styled, where I answer some questions that you might have about this exciting weekend! Feel free to post any additional questions you have in the comments section below, and I will do my best to answer them as soon as possible! How do you decide which events to attend? I know that it gets confusing with the over 200 events listed on the CPW schedule, but you will decide as you go along.  You might be so excited that you want to go through the CPW booklet and highlight every event you want to attend or star each event for every day on your phone so you don't miss a thing (I actually did that) - but relax! Take advantage of every second of CPW by meeting your prospective classmates and doing things with them that you can both enjoy.  Some of my best friends at MIT are the ones that I met at CPW and during orientation/rush, and I remember the fun I had with them more than the specifics of the events that we took part in. My parents are worried about me going to CPW by myself. How do I make them feel assured that I will be okay? I went to CPW alone as a prefrosh, and my agreement with my mother was that I would check in with her via text or phone each day.  I also gave her the number of my host in case she couldn't get in contact with me. If that isn't enough for your parents, you can tell them that MIT has a 24/7 student-run ambulance service filled with volunteer student EMTs, and we are awesome.  We also have MIT Medical right here on campus, which has a walk-in urgent care center, available each day 7am-11pm, in case you are not feeling well.  Additionally, each dormitory has its own collection of Medlinks, which is another student run organization that connects students to MIT Medical by providing over the counter medication and bandaids, as well as other emergency care materials.  If you ever do not feel well or get hurt during the weekend, there is a huge support system here at MIT to help you out.  You can always call the MIT emergency line at 617-253-1212 if you do not feel safe or are in an emergency at any time during the weekend.  If you cannot find a Medlink wherever you are, try to make your way to East Campus and ask for me, Array. I'm a Medlink here in East Campus, and I'd be happy to try my best to heal you :)  How should I approach CPW if I have already ComMITted to MIT versus if I am still considering other schools? (Question submitted by Barbie D. '17) If you have already ComMITted, congratulations! If not...  But in all seriousness, if you have comMITted, focus the weekend on exploring each of the dorms.  Make it your goal to visit an event or party at every dorm, and get a feel for if you fit in well with the culture there. Talk to different upperclassmen and ask them where they live, and do your best to meet as many people as possible, especially your future classmates! Like I said, some of my best friends here at MIT are the ones I met during CPW, such as my friend Emma S. '16, who I make a point to see at least twice each semester even though she lives really far away in Simmons. If you have not comMITted, make it a point to check out the resources that MIT has to offer. Perhaps try attending a class or go to some information sessions for specific programs you are interested in, and try to see how well MIT is a fit for you academically and culturally.   How do I get around campus? What if I want to go somewhere off campus? (Question submitted by Alyssa H. '17) Alyssa H. '17 told me to "tell them where Pika is."  During her CPW last year, she got lost walking to Pika late at night in the cold, and was unsure how to use the MIT shuttles to get back to campus.  She thinks that she is defective for not knowing how to get around Cambridge, but she is not!  I still get lost getting to Pika, which is a co-ed independent living community here at MIT that has awesome events and is a ton of fun to hang out at.   My answer to this is to go to your mobile app store on your phone and download the MIT Mobile app: For Android/Google Play For IPhones This App is MAGIC!  I used it so much during CPW and rush, and it is how I get around campus even today when I am confused about what building I should be in or what bus I should be taking. It gives you up-to-date schedules of the shuttles that are running around campus, such as the Saferide shuttles that run at night, which so happen to go to Pika!  If you do not have a smart phone, I highly recommend finding someone who has one and sticking by them during your time at CPW, because it is really helpful! Additionally, if you find yourself lost and scared at anytime during CPW, call the MIT Police. They are extremely helpful, and they are there for you always, especially if you feel unsafe in any way. Here are some screenshots of the magical application:  How much sleep is the right amount of sleep? (Question submitted by Elena B. '17) Elena B. '17 claimed that she often heard advice from upperclassmen saying that "if you're sleeping enough, you're doing CPW wrong!" However, I have to disagree with that statement to an extent.  There are things going on during CPW at all hours, and it can be overwhelming at times when deciding to miss out on events in order to try and get some sleep.  My advice is to do what feels best for you.  My friend Jake I. '16 and I got so tired at one point during CPW that we just got angry and aggravated at the smallest things, and it got to the point where CPW just wasn't as much fun as it would be with more sleep. So we put away our red bulls from the night and got a good few hours of sleep, which made us feel a lot better. About 4 hours of sleep was about right for me during my CPW.  I stayed awake using energy drinks (my CPW was my first energy drink experience!), and spent the time with my new best friends exploring the Institute in any and every way that we could, and I don't regret it one bit. But your body is different from mine which is different from every other student who goes to MIT and who will be at CPW, and therefore you will need a different amount of sleep from other people. If someone is telling you that you cannot sleep but all you feel like doing is sleeping, go to sleep! You will feel a lot better once you have gotten sleep and you will be able to enjoy the CPW experience a lot more than if your brain is deprived of rest and unable to comprehend anything that is going on. If I am totally in love with one dorm, should I spend more time there? Or should I focus on exploring the other dorms? (Questions submitted by Elena B. '17 and Sebastian G. '17) Like I said, try to go to at least one event at each dorm. But if you go to an event at a dorm and realize that it is your favorite place in the world, I recommend spending the bulk of your time at that dorm.  For example, as a prefrosh, I found that I really fit in at East Campus and Senior House.  After attending events at every single dorm, or at least walking in to each dorm, I spent the rest of my weekend in the East Campus and the Senior House courtyards, trying to figure out which one was a better fit for me.  After all, when you fill out your housing preferences, you have to rank each dorm from first choice to last choice, so you better have a good idea of what each dorm is like so that you can rank them in a not-so-random fashion. How much time should I spend with my host? (Question submitted by Elena B. '17) This is a fantastic question, and one of the reasons why it is a part of the host-matching questionnaire you filled out when you submitted your form that you are attending CPW.  How much time you should spend with your host depends on how you want to spend your CPW.  I barely saw my host during CPW because she was a double major and was extremely busy studying during the weekend, so I spend the weekend with my new friends exploring campus. Last year, I barely saw my prefrosh, Victoria P. '17, even though we were friends before CPW, because she went off to see all of the other dorms and ended up choosing to live in Baker house, which was a better fit for her and I know that she is very happy there today!  I want to make clear that we chose to be CPW hosts because we are excited to meet prefrosh and convince them to come to MIT, and we are here if you need us, but do not feel pressured at all to spend all of your time with us.  You can spend as much or as little time with your host as you would like, but make sure that you do some exploring on your own, too!  Most prefrosh will choose a more flexible option where they check in with their host each day, but are mostly on their own, and this is how I plan on leaving it with my prefrosh. However, if she wants to grab food together or go to an event together, I would be more than willing to do so.  And I am sure that your host feels the same way :) Should I go see what the classes are like? Or should I mostly go to non-academic events? (Question submitted by Elena B. '17) This goes back to the question of "what if I have already ComMITted?"  If you already ComMITted, then you will have four years to see what the classes at MIT are like, go have fun!  It might be a good idea to see what one class is like so you can feel more prepared for your freshmen year, but don't spend all your time on academics, focus on trying to find a living group that best fits you.   If you have not comMITted, then I highly recommend attending some academic events across campus.  Getting a feel for what MIT is like in the classroom and out of the classroom will give you a good idea of if MIT is right for you, and it should help you make your decision. Is CPW a lie? You might hear this rumor from time to time during the weekend. There will be whispers from upperclassmen across the courtyard, bitter from a week of tests and problem sets due. "CPW is a lie," they'll say.  And I disagree, to an extent.  CPW is a time when we MIT students get to show you the things that we love to do and would love to do on an every day basis if we could.  However, it is not a representation of what MIT life is like each day as a student who is hosed with tons of problem sets and exams and studying and labwork and more.  This doesn't mean that CPW is for nothing - you will learn about what MIT students are really like as people, and get a feel for which cultures you fit in with.  MIT can be extremely tough at times, but we like to use CPW and Rush (orientation) as times where we can explode from the inside out with our creativity and passion for what we study and where we live.  Some things about CPW do happen outside of this weekend - we often have burgers grilling in the courtyard of East Campus during the nice weather, and we occasionally enjoy (probably on a monthly basis) smashing old computer equipment and other cruft (usually maybe sometimes in the form of throwing it out windows).  We also have hair dyeing parties and various other carnivals during the year.  It just isn't every single day, like during CPW. Are upperclassmen scary? (Question submitted by William L. '16) Yes.  William L. '16 says that when he was a prefrosh, he thought that it was scary talking to upperclassmen, or current MIT students, about what it is like to go to MIT.  But now, he is extremely excited to talk to you, and "suck the happiness out of you."  He is kidding, don't worry. In all seriousness though, come and talk to us! We want to be your friends and we love MIT so much that we want to share our joy and experiences with you! Ask us questions, let us dye your hair, let us take you on tours of campus (I can show you where Baker house is, if you would like), and more! "Has anyone really been far, even as decided to use -- even go -- want to do look more like?" (Question submitted by Max J. '17) I don't understand Max, if you understand this please comment below and say mean things about him. How do I meet the bloggers? Connie H. '15 has a blog post regarding where you can find the bloggers around campus during CPW, but also you can come and meet all of us Friday on the third floor of the Student Center (W20) from 9pm-10:30pm.  We want to see you and talk to you! I'll even show you more pictures of cats if you want! What are some other "don't miss" events? (Question submitted by Elena B. '17) These are some of my favorites! I can't wait to meet all of you at CPW!  AHH CPW! Let me know if you want to come meet Galileo :) He is even more excited than me about CPW!  i'm from albany, california, which is a tiny square mile and a half next to berkeley, california. as a result, i say hella... hella. my life goal is to be on extreme couponing: all-stars. my other life goal is to avoid being on hoarders: buried alive. i... read more  see complete archives  When the CPW schedule came out  when I was a prefrosh 50000 years ago, I turned into a puddle of excitement. A puddle!  I tried to plan out a full itinerary and ended up with something like this:  ... and miserably failed at attending all the events I had hoped to be at. While this is not a guide to optimizing your CPW experience... here are a few things I wish I knew as a prefrosh! 1) Your host loves you, so try your best to get to know them! Remember that your host is fully aware of the commitment of hosting a prefrosh, so don't feel like you are a burden. However, you shouldn't plan on glomming onto your hostremember that campus is filled with hundreds of other prefrosh just like you, so it'd be a shame to not go out and meet them :) 2) The MIT Mobile application will help you navigate across campus and on the Boston side where you might find events from FSILGS. Download it and check it out! You can also use whereis.mit.edu for a simple Google Maps version of campus. Don't be afraid to explore - there are great events that are often a shuttle ride away. 3) You can catch up on sleep when you get home. Don't feel guilty for wanting to stay up and try everything. :) You've earned it! 4) CPW is still school for us! (unfortunately) If your host has classes on Thursday and Friday, or club meetings throughout CPW, or a bit of studying or problem sets to do for next week... then your host is indeed an MIT student! Don't fret and feel like they don't want to spend time with youthey are often trying their best to clear their schedule for you. :D ~~~~~~~ And if you want to find a blogger for some life guidance? Here's where you'll find us this CPW: I will be... Anna H. '14 will be... Rachel D. '16 will be...   Erick P. '17 will be...   Emad T. '14 will be...   And blogger or notdon't be afraid to ask a student tough questions if you're looking for deeper answers. Beyond our hopes that CPW is one of the craziest experiences of your life, we hope that it answers a lot of your questions if you do have a tough choice to make. My CPW host helped me understand why MIT was a good fit for me. :) Oh and... 5) Bring a pair of comfortable shoes you can walk, run and climb in. For uhh... exploring. One would think that after seven years in this office I would not be as excited about the start of Campus Preview Weekend (CPW). Yet, after all this time, I never cease to be thrilled to get to finally meet all of our admitted students and those parents who are on campus as well.  The first question I often hear from parents is, "what events should I attend with my child?" In truth, there won't be very many of them if you are each doing what interests you the most. With hundreds of options over the next few days, there are lots of things to choose from and parents will probably not want answers to the same questions that students will. That said, it's important to check in occasionally so I'd suggest you pick an event where you can meet up with your student each day (perhaps the CPW Welcome/Faculty Speaker event on Friday morning and the Closing Variety Show on Saturday evening) but mostly I hope you will encourage them do their own thing and know that it's good for you to do the same. Its the best way for them to figure out if they are comfortable and at home on our campus and the best way for you to be comfortable with them being here. I hope youll ask lots of questions. Its the way our students learn and will work well for you too. Current students are great resources so dont be afraid to ask them about their experiences. In addition we've enlisted the help of a great group of current students' parents called Parent Connectors. They'll be available throughout the weekend to address those issues that are most important to you, the parent, so don't be afraid to ask for their opinions...they know exactly how you feel since they were asking those same questions just a year or so ago. They are also easy to locate in their red Parent Connector polo shirts so keep a lookout for them. A great place to find a parent to talk to would be in the Parents Hospitality Lounge. Grab a cup of coffee or tea and chat with current MIT parents as well as other parents of MIT prefrosh. Also, learn about the MIT Parents Association and the Parent Connector Network from current volunteers and staff. I hope youll be open-minded during your visit with us. I have lived with current students and their life at MIT is somewhat different than mine was when I was here. I'm sure you'll feel the same way too. It's just not the way we remember it. I remember fondly my mothers first less than ecstatic comments in viewing my dorm when I was a student at MIT but for me it was the perfect choice for my four years at MIT. Bring comfortable shoes and a jacket or sweater and perhaps even an umbrella. Weather can change quickly in Boston, especially in the springtime, so you should be prepared for anything. Boston is a great walking city and I hope you'll take some time to see the environs around MIT as well the campus itself and the best way to do that is on foot. Even just a short walk along the river can be a nice break from all the events of the day. Have questions regarding your student's financial aid package or the financial aid process in general? There will be an open house Thursday, Friday and Saturday at Student Financial Services so you can stop in and get your questions answered. On Thursday and Friday there will be comprehensive presentations by Executive Director of Student Financial Services, Elizabeth Hicks. Parents and students are welcome to attend either of these programs on the hows, whys and whens of financial aid at MIT -- how your financial aid award was determined, when your supplemental forms are due, how to pay your balance, how to find on-campus student employment, and how your online student account will work and much more. But that is just the beginning... Events Panels & Sessions Ive named just a handful of the events created with you in mind for CPW and it really is just the tip of the iceberg. We'll provide you with a full schedule when you get here but to get a head start on your plans check out the online listings on our CPW site.  See you soon!  Last year, the admitted students of the Class of 2017 got invitations to Admitted Student Gatherings, social events for mingling with other prefrosh, current MIT students, and MIT Alumni. The one closest to me was hosted by the MIT Club of Northern New Jersey. As the only accepted MIT student in the immediate area, I was pretty excited to meet other 2017's in person...and to stuff my face with the alumni's homemade desserts! It was held at one of the alum's house and started with a typical question and answer session. A New Jersey MIT freshman had come from her spring break to tell us about experiences thus far at MIT, from astronomy classes to being on the fencing team to more general "time management tips". Afterwards was social hour, where I met some really cool alumni. Especially interesting were the alumni who majored in 6-2 Computer Science and Electrical Engineering, which I wanted as my major. It was amazing seeing how much the fields of computer science and electrical engineering had evolved over the span of just a few years. The gathering also got me really pumped me up as I began coordinating with my new NJ MIT friends what events we should do as soon as we got there.     This year, I got a similar email, but with one crucial difference:  My turn to come down during my spring break and be the MIT freshman with all the answers. My turn to be the "cool kid" on the block. They're the eager prefrosh who have questions about MIT life and can't wait to set foot on MIT at CPW. My turn to tell them about my experiences at MIT and what I've gone through so far. I began to wonder what kinds of questions they would ask. Would they ask about housing? The meal plans? Greek life? How to not rip out your hair while doing PSets? It's a good thing that my very job for the entire past semester was telling people about my MIT experiences. So I put on enough makeup to hide the bags under my sleep-deprived eyes and to mask the tolls that MIT stress had taken on me (just kidding!) and went with my mom and dad to the gathering on the Saturday of my spring break. The question and answer session itself was pretty casual. Two other MIT students were there with me: Ben Chazen and Liana Ilutzi (who I decree must only be referred to as Ms. President due to her status as President of the Class of 2017). We took turns tackling the various questions about meal plans, housing, dorm life, UROPs, and things to do for fun. One prefrosh asked how I balanced my work, sleep, and social life. My answer was "Simple. I do my work during the day, sleep during the night, and hang out with friends in my dreams." Afterwards we stuck around and talked to the different prefrosh before heading out. I had a fun time, and I definitely look forward to doing it again for the MIT Club of NNJ's other events.        I hope you enjoyed this post, but if if you prefrosh are so uncontrollably excited for CPW tomorrow that you temporarily forgot how to read words, I've been there.

One thing most of them have in common though are the scale and weight of the exams. Another non-trivial difference between academics at Cambridge and MIT is the way exams and grades work. MIT runs under a continuous assessment school of thought. Throughout the semester you'll take 1-3 tests + final and have quite a few problem sets/labs/papers that are continually assessing your knowledge. At Cambridge there is significantly less graded coursework. The supervision work I talked about last week is only graded for your benefit and doesn't contribute to your final grade. With that said though the supervisors provide reports where they predict how you'll do on the corresponding paper of the EXAMS. 1B Computer Scientists have 4 courses that do have graded coursework though. One thing to keep in mind for all of this graded coursework is that they are all based on ticks, a pass/fail system where it's all or nothing. And until early June that is all that is graded. Once June hits you take EXAMS. There are 4 papers that are each 9-10 questions long. You have 3 hours for each paper and choose 5 questions to answer on each one. What this means is that you can answer questions for subjects you're more comfortable with and ignore classes (*cough*ComputerGraphics*cough) all together. These four papers will collectively cover 20 examinable subjects of which 16 have been covered already. Compsci exams are June 2nd-5th. Luckily we have two hefty 5 week breaks to revise all this material, which is exactly what everyone does. Here's what a day revising looks like. It's crucial that I wake up early because while I won't BE productive for the next three hours, I'll definitely FEEL productive(arguably more important). Now that I'm awake I can hit snooze for an hour. After the umpteenth alarm goes off I'll finally muster up the power to roll out of bed and grab some breakfast making materials. I swipe open the curtains and let out a small groan as my eyes blink themselves awake. With bagels, a tea bag and some peanut butter in hand I make the small trek to the kitchen to start my day. Once breakfast is made I usually head back to my room to enjoy the actual eating portion. Because my hands are in use this is the perfect time to catch up on all the wonderful video content the Americans have released while I was sleeping. After that I'll watch an episode of whatever TV show I'm following (currently Samurai Champloo) and make the mistake of going on Reddit. A short time warp later. It's about this time that any feeling of productivity I felt for waking up early is completely gone. I'll usually glance over at my pile of papers  and desperately look for excuses to not start studying. A quick peek in the bathroom shows me that my body wash is going to run out! Well, I can't have that now, better get dressed and cycle down to Sainsbury's. Man, I'm feeling more productive already. Wait, is that Ernesto '15 over there! We still haven't planned our trip to Amsterdam, I wonder if he's busy. After a quick chat with Ernesto we've decided to plan the whole trip today. This is a day of productivity packed in a few hours, I'm so glad I was running out of body wash. I say my goodbyes, cycle back home and start to make lunch. 15 minutes later my delicious ramen is ready to be consumed. <See Eating Breakfast and Interneting> At this point all the feelings of productivity have washed away. I've realized that planning the trip was productive but it also means that I'll be out of comission for 3 full days. Time to start studying. But first I need to find some music/tv/movies for background noise. Everyone studies differently but this is how I prefer to do it. <See Eating Lunch and More Interneting> It's around this point everyday that I realize how much of the day has been wasted. Once I've made this realization I slack off a little bit more and make some final attempt to feel productive. I'll either go back to studying, start a blog post or take a walk. And then I'll hype myself up for the CRAZY amount of work I'm going to get done tomorrow. Well, if the day is shot anyway might as well watch another episode of Samurai Champloo. Need my beauty sleep to get up at 8 for the insane amount of work I'm going to get done.   And then repeat ad nauseum. At this rate I'll be ready for exams by late September. October at the latest. I know I used this joke on Facebook a few weeks ago. Forgive my lack of originality. If you were offered a place on our wait list in March, you should have received an email from us last Friday about completing the Wait List Form. Whether you wish to remain on MIT's wait list or not, please complete the form and submit it by April 25, 2014. In the meantime, be sure to enroll in another college/university by May 1 (even if it means making a deposit). There won't be further news on the wait list until mid-May, once we know how many students have enrolled and thus, how many more students we will be able to admit to the Class of 2018. If you have any questions about the wait list, refer to this post for some helpful tips and advice.  If you were wait listed, but did not receive an email with instructions, check to make sure it's not in your spam folder. Otherwise, send an email to admissions [at] mit [dot] edu with your name and Application ID and we'll get back to you. Two weeks ago was our Spring Break at MIT, and the halls of Tetazoo were empty.  The cats were begging for attention for the first time in what seems like forever, as their owners left them for hiking mountains or driving across the country or exploring caves. Yet I was here, at MIT, preparing myself for the UPOP Spring Team Training Camp.  UPOP, or the Undergraduate Practice Opportunities Program, is a program for sophomores that prepares us for success in the workplace.  Throughout the year, we have obtained guidance, support, and training in our internship searches and in preparation for the summer and the future.  UPOP also holds a week-long program for sophomores during IAP, however, since I trained to be an EMT during IAP, I could not attend the week-long program.  Instead, I attended a three-day program during Spring Break where I worked in a team with an MIT alum as a mentor to work on our teamwork skills. I really enjoyed working with my team during the week. Our group had seven people in it, one of which I knew prior to the program and five of which became my new friends.  Our mentor was really awesome - she was an alum from the class of '82, and she had a lot of really great input on our projects and various modules during the program. UPOP was Monday-Wednesday from 9am-5pm, so it did get a bit tiring, but the coordinators surely kept us off our feet and very involved.  We'd start off each day with announcements, where the coordinators, Bethany and Sharon, would yell "HEY UPOP" and we would yell back "HEY UPOP."  My group is the table in the middle, Table 3.  We named ourselves Team 2048, after the extremely addicting game. We even had a team chant going "Two-Oh-Four-Eight Who do we appreciate? ____" where ____ was either UPOP or the name of our mentor. I think it might have irked some of the other teams a bit, but it made us really happy. We had a good time working together during the week, and even coordinated our outfits for some events, like for our major presentation on the last day of UPOP.  We don't look very happy in that picture, but we did feel really passionate about what we were presenting about.  We chose to present on the issue of dorm security here at MIT, and about how the current program is inconsistent, and sometimes unfair, across the dormitories.  Last semester, I tried to bring a prefrosh into Simmons hall to see the dining hall, and security stopped me and told me that I was not allowed to enter the building with the prefrosh, even if I was on the guest list and the prefrosh had a non-MIT ID.  Many other people have had similar things happen to them or are experiencing new problems with our outsourced securities systems, and it is causing some distress among MIT students. Overall, our presentation went really well! We were proud of how we had worked together, and about the final product.  Kaylee B. '16 is an opinion writer for the Tech, and she might post something in the near future about what we presented on! We had fun with the other projects we worked on, which included negotiation workshops, presentation workshops, and more!  This is my friend Kaylee B. '16 being very passionate about our discussion. One of the coolest projects we worked on was creating the tallest building that we could out of foam and pencils.  We had a limited amount of money to buy a limited amount of materials.  The building needed to pass a "tilt test" with a water bottle at the top of it to make sure that it was "earthquake safe." In the end, our group passed the tilt test, but still lost terribly due to its height.  However, we had the prettiest design! This is our tower:  Here I am with Serena P. '16 and Caitlin H. '16 working on the tower:  And obtaining those materials wasn't that easy!  That's Kaylee B. '16 helping carry foam over from the store, also known as the Foam Dome and the Cut Hut.  We spent all our money on pencils and foam blocks.   However, we lost in the end to a team with a 70"+ tour.  Even though my team lost, we wanted to show our spirit and how grateful we were for mentor's help, so after the winning team passed the tilt test we did our team cheer and at the end we yelled "Marissa!"  However, a girl from the winning team yelled "You guys lost!" and laughed at us. I didn't think it was funny, it was mean. So congrats team four for winning that round, you guys did a great job! Except no congratulations to whoever shouted that.  Overall, UPOP was a lot of fun.  I made a lot of really great new friends, and some of them even came back with Kaylee and me to East Campus after the last day of UPOP for a tour of our halls!  Caitlin H. '16 and Zara P. '16 liked East Campus, and they also loved the cats, of course!  After UPOP was over, I headed back home to New York to see my family, which included my puppy, Boots!  I wished him a happy belated birthday. My little puppy is five years old now! In celebration of my dad and I becoming certified EMTs this year, my family went out to a really fancy dinner place, Insignia, with some gift cards my mom had received from co-workers during the holiday season.  Insignia was a Sushi Steakhouse, so with me being a vegetarian I was a bit worried that I would be stuck eating fancy salad (even though salad is super yummy).  However, the waitress suggested that I try a "watermelon steak," and it was so good!  It was one of the strangest and tastiest foods I've ever had.  It was grilled watermelon over steamed vegetables with a yummy balsamic-y glaze over the top.  I am definitely going to try it again! So next time you're at a barbeque and there's watermelon, try throwing it on the grill!  Apparently it is a thing! Overall, I quite enjoyed my spring break. It started off kind of shakey on the weekend, but it was a much needed break from the craziness that is MIT. And it was a great rest for the cats, who quickly became bored of us as soon as people started returning from their adventurous spring breaks.  All UPOP pictures were taken by the UPOP Marketing and Communications Officer, Jessica Jones. And psych! Happy April Fools Day! I didnt celebrate it in particularly grand style, but I do plan to give some of my friends heart-attack-worthy lies over the next couple of days. And this blogpost is all about the art of lying. We all know good lies contain a grain of truth, like how CPW shows that MIT is a series of nearly back-to-back all-nighters, except that events, games and making new friends are replaced with p-sets, p-sets and chatting with hosed friends. Well...dont take my word on that. Nah, actually, you probably can. Its been a few days since Spring Break ended, and the break was truly wonderful. Apart from spending a great deal of time writing new short stories, I saw and spent time with my mom. I hadnt seen her in nearly nine months, so I was shaking with all the excitement of an excited train guy howling about trains and then infinitely more. It was a beautiful week. Now, Im back to the usual battle with problem sets and stubborn, crashing codes. Taking breaks like this to write is always a cause for celebration.  And, on the surface at least, thats what this post is about. Fiction is the truth inside the lieStephen KingI like writing about MIT, about the tumbling rollercoaster rides and endless head-bashing we face against problem sets, about the students, about wondering if the Alchemist Statue will one day rise and kill us all. You can almost feel its venom building up like Voldemorts, just before he melodramatically shrieks, Avada Kedavra! at Harry Potter in the penultimate forest scene of the final movie. I see you, evil statue. I know your plan. But as much as I enjoy writing for the blogs, I spend the bulk of my time writing about imagined worlds, about heartbroken moms and bullied kids, depressed serial killers and cautious illegal immigrants. At this point, I must have written at least a hundred different stories, most of them unfinished. They kind of just sit impatiently in my Documents Folder, bidding me to hasten and complete their worlds. Except that each snippet of a plot I type up doesnt feel like a world Im creating. It feels like one I'm discovering. These people, with their dreams and their stories, escaped from some universe, a piece of a jigsaw puzzle Im privy to. And the more time I spend with them, the more pieces jump out; the more I begin to see where they want me to delve into. From memory, my earliest attempt at a story occurred in grade four. I wrote an 84-paged tale titled, The Cries of Emeka, a literary atrocity that spewed prose with all the harmony of brain-dead chimpanzees banging on drums. My saving grace existed in my cluelessness. I had no idea I was such a terrible writer, and thus, I wrote more frequently. Just before grade 7, I had my Star Wars phase, and was so awestruck by the movies that I instantly wanted to find a world like that. From this, Sagittarius was born. Sagittarius may be my most meaningful endeavor yet, one I began over six years ago, one that Ive barely scratched the surface of, as of today. I spent all of high school writing this six-part sci-fi series, about a planet called Sagittarius, one of many in a collection of star systems ruled by the Cosmotic Federation. Wha? Well, thats not really a good description, but as the plot tends to meander in all directions Im clueless on how to summarize it. I completed Sagittarius in grade 11. The first draft at least. I had written everything on paper (my boarding high school was very anti-laptop. And pretty much anti-anything that could be associated with batteries). At its completion, there were two thousand or more pages. Only two people had read the entire thing, and their inputs played much part in what feels like my formative years. After completing Sagittarius (the first draft at least), I decided to go on a writing hiatus. At several moments, writing had clashed with my academic work. Even at moments when missing classes to study for the IMO had me really hosed, I still gave large portions of my time to writing, and as drawn as I was to the art of having characters do stupid plot-convenient things (snerk), I knew I couldnt keep it up for long. Which was really just a stupid lie because as long as I wanted to keep it up, I could. And thus, the break following grade 11, when my family and I saw news of a kidnapping, when my parents began talking about it, something flew in. It was a man, bloody-faced and bound in ropes. I wasnt seeing him on the television. He was somewhere in my mind, writhing in agony. He was trying to say something, but I couldnt make much from his muffled croaks. And I instantly knew I wanted more. A new phase began. Over the course of months, I began to see more and more of the mans world, and the people around it. When I couldnt connect the dots floating in my head, I tried to force some connection, but as long as it didnt feel right, as long as it didnt feel natural, I refused to move on with it. By the end of my final year, I had enough of the pieces to begin drawing life into them, to begin dragging these people out of my head and flooding them into an empty 11KB Word Document. The writing process is, at its peak, a delightful and immersive process. Ive found that the more involved I was in a story, the more my heart and mind seemed to tie themselves around it. I remember writing a story two months ago about a family of illegal immigrants. I didnt know much about the issue as it related to the US prior to writing the story, but I had a little piece of it with me, and I was convinced that to discover the rest, I simply had to know more about the issue itself. Cue to a long, near-sleepless night spent on Wikipedia and government pages and blogs and mini-documentaries. And I suddenly knew what had happened to the characters in my head, what had to happen. The stories I write are typically darkI have no idea why; they just seem to mold onto the shapes of the vulgar and the sinister. And for this specific scene, I found something wrong with me. I was supposed to describe a deatha man close to the main character had met his end in a graffiti-ridden alleyway, his belongings stolen, his throat slit. And when the main character found out, as I typed up the words of his discovery and his shell-shock, I felt two layers. There was the exterior layer, the blank-faced me, just typing the words, just watching the scene play out from somewhere intangible. And then there was the interior layer, a blend of myself and the character. I could feel his horror. I could feel his pain. It was a kind of distant pain, hushed by the presence of the exterior, but it still felt raw. It still felt real. And as heartache was inflicted on this person that I was cared about, the words just bled onto the page. Yes, hes trying to say these things. No, he cant. Hes just standing there, paralyzed. His mouth is open and I can see it. I can see the people around him. I can feel the heaviness in the air, a toxic charged cloud that seems to hold everyones joints in stasis. And this is what writing fiction feels like. When writing about the serial killer, youre suddenly the serial killer. You see the victim from his excited eyes. You can feel his breath puffing up your throat and out your lips on this warm night. You can see why he has to do it, why the girl has to die. And you can feel him charging forward, his shadow winking in and out of a line of trees. And suddenly, you can feel the girl as he draws her up close. You can hear her screams as his knife comes down. You can feel the resistance as a cold blade meets the bone beneath warm flesh. And when youre the girls mother, standing in court and staring at the face of the killer, youve forgotten the wash of emotions that overwhelmed you as the girl died. You see nothing but a repugnant, hateful, disgusting man. Your grief and fury cant be expressed in enough words, but you can feel it and you can attempt to transmute it into letters. You can feel the impulse to reach for his face and break it. You see your girl, think of her smile just before she slipped out into the night. You remember how you almost called her backjust a thoughtless whim at the time (too cold out dear, just come back in and go tomorrow). But now, now, it could have been everything. The line between salvation and demise. Shes dead. Shes gone forever. And suddenly, youre not the mom, but an observer, riding the clouds and watching the lives of these people play out. And somehow, you know that theres a lot the mom doesnt know. You know that when she steps out of the court, a set of intricate dominoes will fall, dominoes set up by another person. You know that she will soon meet the same fate her daughter did. *** And when Im writing, the world around me just fades. People mutter, songs play, cars zoom by, but I dont know about any of that. I dont care. What matters now are the people and their world, a world Ive spent ages trying to piece together, to delve into, a world that I now understood well enough to talk to you about. I used to care about how good my stories were, how real my characters were. But I dont anymore. While I still try to take writing classes and soak up as much lessons of literature as I can, I never let the fear that my writing might suck stop me from typing the stories I want to type. But this wasnt always the case. *** The last huge piece of writing I typed up, over the course of my gap year, is titled, Whirlwind of Metamorphosis. Its set in Nigeria, and describes how a kidnapping initiates a series of increasingly worse events on a family. My cousin read it over Spring Break and wondered why so many awful things were happening. When we discussed it, I wasnt entirely struck by how many hopefully heartfelt compliments she had to offer, despite the overall morbidity of the characters situation. I was awestruck by how she talked about them the same way she could about people shed seen in the news, real people somewhere out there, facing real problems. And it took me a while to realize that even if she had thought differently, say, even if she had thought they were two-dimensional cardboard characters, spewing the kind of stereotypical crap we might expect people of their profiles to spew, it wouldnt matter. I always set to every story with the best of intentions. Flaws were more than inevitable; they were necessary. I had to be aware of their existence, but I wouldnt let them hold me back. I realized this when, halfway through Whirlwind of Metamorphosis, I stopped writing the story. I wasnt sure of its sense of direction. I wasnt sure of its artistic merit. It felt like a tumbling mess of words penned by the typical trite monkey with a typewriter. And so for two months, I did other things. I watched TV shows and solved math olympiad problems. I taught at my high school and transferred the contents of the home refrigerator into their true homemy stomach. I did anything but write. My mom wondered why. Shed known I was working up a story. Id actually told her some of the starting events. And she wondered why I wasnt writing anymore. When she realized that I wasnt jaded or burnt out, just afraid and uncertain, she went along the lines of Well, even if what you write makes no sense, its still several pages better than something that doesnt even exist. I did end up finishing the book. And it did end up getting accepted for publication.      On print, it came out to about 547 pages. ***Why did I start writing anything in the first place? Why do I decide to write anything?  I dont know. The answer my mind wants to give goes along the lines of: there are things my mouth cant utter that my hand can; there are feelings I cant voice to an ear that a page can hold in confidence. I write because I have something to say, if only to myself. And this feels right. But in all honesty, theres such an element of joy, of fundament, to writing. Its such a big and indispensable part of my life that the more truthful answer seems like: I have something to say because I write. Writing has been with me from the onset, and its empowered me to describe things that would have otherwise had no voicefrom intimate secrets to ghastly tales.  And to you, friend, still somehow reading, I know that theres something that makes you light up. Whether you can describe it or not, there are things that you just want to pursue and jump into with tidal fury. Things you love. Things you think you could love if you tried Pursue them. The more you do, the deeper into yourself youll seem to collapse. These things will tie themselves so deeply to you that their growth will mean yours. And when fear comes, gnarly, mutated, rising from the shadows, when you begin to get doubts, and when you begin to lose motivation, remind yourself that youre really doing these things for yourself. And why should it matter if they're imperfect or error-ridden? They're for you. When you're not thinking of others, you're able to enjoy them, and that's really what matters.  I dont know what the future holds. I dont know if Ill ever publish another book or if Im destined for a lifetime of rejection slips from apologetic publishing presses. But I know that no matter what, Ill always want to write.***  One of the academic differences between MIT and Cambridge is that instead of having recitations they have supervisions . A supervision consists of 1-3 students and a supervisor that is either a graduate student, who has some background with the course, or a professor/fellow. These supervisions are setup within your college (another system I'll talk about in a future blog) and are where a significant portion of learning happens at Cambridge. Here's a handy chart I threw together to show contact time at MIT vs Cambridge for IB Computer Scientists (it varies heavily based on year and course). But the difference doesn't end at class size or contact hours. Course work at Cambridge revolves around supervisions. Each supervision is paired with some form of work. This work could consist of an essay, pset style questions, or past exam problems. The goal is to finish the work and hand it in 24 hours before the supervision so that they have time to grade it and provide feedback. What actually happens in the supervision is largely dependent on the supervisor. And thus we get to the point of this post. Since coming to cambridge I've had a wide array of supervisors and I've noticed that there are seven types of supervisors/recitation leaders you'll encounter, each with their pros and cons. Disclaimer: All of the supervisors I've had this year have been absolutely wonderful and this post is just my poor attempt at a joke. Mostly. Major Trait: Can explain any subject with startling clarity. This individual is truly a cut above the rest. Every student who has had them will have a story of how given 20 more minutes they would've given a solution to the halting problem. You'll spend hours working on a problem only to have it explained in 5 minutes. But the supervisor doesn't usually stop there, they push you to fully understand the solution and be able reproduce the answer. When you're completely stumped in a lecture for a course that they are supervising, you stop taking notes because you know it'll make more sense when they teach it to you. You'll run into these supervisors once in a blue moon, treasure the short time you have and hope they'll supervise future courses.   Major Trait: Draws the most beautiful mathematical symbols you've ever seen.  This supervisor has one simple motto, there is no theorem, lemma or concept that isn't better understood. with a rigorous proof  While there is more than a grain of truth in this motto, you typically won't be examined on rigorous proofs. You'll come with questions about how to solve a specific type of question that's appeared in the last 8+ years' exams and you'll leave with 5 pages of rigorous proofs and no more knowledge on how to solve the question. Some people love these supervisors, others can't stand them, it all depends on your personal learning style.   Major Trait: Isn't held down by the shackles of a syllabus. This supervisor has taken their own spin on things. Ignoring the recommend supervision topics they decide to teach whatever they find most interesting.  While it's always relevant to the course and uses topics you have touched on, it'll take an interesting detour that isn't examinable. This supervisor is also hit or miss for students. This method of teaching is useful for those who understand the lectured material and would like to get a further understanding that's outside the scope of the class. On the other hand, learning material outside of the syllabus is frustrating when you don't already understand the lectured material.  Major Trait: Sees nothing wrong with thousands of unread emails. Not much to say about this supervisor because chances are you still haven't had the supervisions yet. You send email after email and never receive a response. It kind of makes you wonder how a computer scientist survives so long not checking his email. Hopefully you'll get through to them before exams roll around!   Major Trait: Has an unrivaled ice-cold gaze. This supervisor comes in many shapes and sizes. They can be intense in that they expect a lot of you or they can be really into the subject at hand, but these aren't the type of intense supervisor I want to concentrate on. Instead, I want to discuss the supervisor who's just overall intense. You can never feel truly comfortable in their presence and supervisions tend to have awkward staring matches where no one wins. Time will slow to a crawl as you work on the same question for half an hour with no aid. I'm shivering just thinking about it.   Major Trait: It doesn't matter how early you hand in your work, they still won't get around to marking it. This is a tough supervisor to have because you'll find yourself asking the awful question "Can I skip this question without anyone noticing?". And then a few weeks later when you're late night psetting that question will shift to "How much of this problem set can I get away with skipping". By the end of term your work will consist of a few thrown together answers(in beautiful LaTeX) and a slew of question marks. Unlike MIT there won't be be graded psets and midterms to force you to do the work,.Exams are in June and it's up to you to have learned the material by then!   Major Trait: Reliability, you can be sure they've prepared for the supervision. This will be the supervisor you run into most often. They'll mark your problem sets, give you useful feedback and answer any questions you might have, heck, they'll even bring candy once in a while. If these last two terms have taught me anything it's that supervisions, much like recitations, are my saving grace. Where as I'll usually be too afraid to ask questions in lecture of 80+ peers, it's easier ask questions in a supervision of 2-3 (in fact, it's extremely awkward if I don't ). And that concludes my list of the seven supervisors. Sorry for the long delay between posts, I hope to get back to the 1 post a week/fortnight schedule I held this summer. Let me know if there are any topics you want me to cover! The grass is always greener on the other side. Or that's what they say anyways.  When I applied to the Cambridge- MIT Exchange (CME) program, I was pretty excited about the grass.The CME program lets MIT and Cambridge University students swap places for a year (or in my case, a semester because Mechanical Engineering has a special program). The experiences are quite different at both places and listening to the stories from other MIT students who had gone abroad made me really interested in the program. They talked about how they didn't have as much weekly work (we have homework once every two weeks for each class), ate fancy three-course meals called Formal Halls, and of course attended these huge celebrations at the end of exams called May Balls. Plus the college system (similar to Yale), each with their own colors and crest, honestly reminded me of Harry Potter (Cliche, I know...). Although leaving MIT for even a semester seemed really sad, I saw it as an opportunity to experience something new, maybe even something better. Fast forward a couple months to Fall semester after I'd committed to studying abroad...I don't think I've ever had a more brutal fall semester than the one that hit my Junior fall.IHTFP. All day. Every day. Part of the problem was that I was taking this deathly combination of classes to prepare for my semester abroad. The work load from one of my lab classes was incredibly heavy since we had weekly labs/reports and also an individiual project where I needed to make 40+ cups of tea. I was taking one of the most notoriously difficult classes at MIT, 2.006 or Thermal Fluids II (think turbines, compressors, and cycles), which I wasn't sure if I was going to pass pretty much the whole semester... Plus I was spending all my time on the only class I actually derived any joy from: 2.008, AKA yo-yos! Another part of the problem was that I don't think I was making enough time for myself. I wasn't sleeping enough (indeed there were many nights where I slept after my roommates and was up before them in the morning), my activities became more burdensome than fun (as a result of unanticipated circumstances), and I didn't make time to do things that would let me relax like baking, drawing, and taking photos.But I, like many MIT students, lived by Winston Churchill's quote:"If you're going through hell, keep going."  And I made it through. -------------------------------------------------------------My three months here at Cambridge Unversity have been a much needed break from MIT. I was burned out after last semester, and I don't know how I would've made it through another Spring semester (which for some reason is always the more difficult semester for me). Although I'm not as involved as Nati, I'm kind of taking this semester to do the things that I enjoy doing and recuperate.  Since I've been here, I got into running...  baked a ton...   and have been taking more photos!  Cambridge has been a wonderful experience so far, and my time here has helped me put my MIT experience in a new framework. I appreciate that. I'll never take for granted the wonderfully fast, universally-available and fast wifi, the single faucets in our sink (we have separate hot and cold faucets here), and of course the incredible amount of funding for class projects, activities, and research at MIT. That's not to say that Cambridge doesn't also have its wonderful things as well! I enjoy that I have more time to sit and learn the material, instead of drinking through the firehose. We also have these things called supervisions, which are hour-long meetings with a grad student tp talk about the problems you worked on for the past two weeks. Our work is not graded, so there's not too much pressure to just finish the work in time to submit things. Additionally, I'm taking a couple of courses here on materials which talk about different properties that were discovered or researched here at Cambridge University.  The city of Cambridge itself is also incredibly beautiful. But instead of boring you with more words, I figured I'd just take you along on my morning walk to the department so you can get a taste of what it's like to study abroad at Cambridge.  You: Where are you from?Me: London.You: But you...you don't...you don't seem to have a British accent.Me: Correct. Let me explain!

We switched off the generator and the glaring light died. A flurry of moths, freed from the beacon that had attracted them, flew off into the darkness. Three thousand feet below us, fireworks were going off with a faint, delayed crackle. Most nights, this summit was shrouded in mist, but evidently the clouds had taken New Years Eve off. Despite the view, we were alone. The only people crazy enough to camp on the mountaintop were those who would travel to Brazil to study insects.. - - - First, an explanation of who I am and why Im posting on Annas blog. Im an alum of French House. I graduated in 2012 with a double major in Math (combinatorics) and Music (opera singing). I then spent a year in Berlin, Germany, and now am back at MIT to start a Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics. Hi!Most children grow up thinking bugs are cool; I never stopped. It started with butterflies and dragonflies, but eventually I fell in love with moths. Turns out that one in ten species on Earth (including bacteria and plants) is a moth. Many are large and colorful. Some are rare and exciting. Most are beautiful if you stop to look.     Moths of Vermont: Chocolate prominent and maple callus borer moth.      Moths of Vermont: Chocolate prominent and maple callus borer moth. I live in the middle of the woods in Vermont (yes, I wear flannel and do square dancing), and I started photographing the moths at my home. By the end of high school, Id found over five hundred species. Then MIT happened and I happily forgot about insects for four years in a wealth of friends, classes, and math. During my senior year, I realized that I would have a whole summer free after graduation, and I remembered my early childhood dream of finding insects in the rainforest. Surely, that couldnt happen, but there was nothing to lose in trying. Lesson 1. Google is awesome.I searched for moths brazil and this was the first hit. Look, here was an organization that actually needed help identifying and photographing moths in the rainforest! Unfortunately, I also had to get there, and tickets to Brazil are expensive.Lesson 2. If youre passionate and determined about your project, sometimes people will support you.I first tried to get funding through a public service program. I failed, and almost decided to give up. My application had been rejected; that must mean that my idea was silly.As a last hope, I went to see MISTI. This program helps MIT students find foreign internships. I wasnt looking for a standard internship, but I had nothing to lose. Half an hour later I was told I had a plane ticket. MIT-Brazil was a new program without much money, but they would be delighted to support me if I worked hard in the interests of conservation.A CD arrived in the mail from the Reserva Ecologica de Guapiacu (REGUA). On it were over a thousand photographs of unidentified moths. Could I please identify them all? *gulp* Well, this was what Id asked for Dawn over the Atlantic rainforest.  Dawn over the Atlantic rainforest. REGUA is part of the Atlantic rainforest. Most of this ecosystem has been destroyed: its much more endangered than the Amazon. About half the species are found nowhere else in the world, and naturalists are racing to identify and protect whats there before it vanishes forever. Almost nobody is studying the moths. There are just too many of them! Certainly, theres no field guide or anything like that. To identify a species, you have to search through museum collections or hope that theres a photo on the web. Can you tell that these moths are the same?      Two photographs of the moth Epia Muscosa (left photo by Alan Martin).       Two photographs of the moth Epia Muscosa (left photo by Alan Martin). After reading about moths and malaria and What To Do If You Meet A Jaguar, I arrived in another world. The rainforest is a solid block of plants. There are trees and ferns and tree ferns (ferns the size of trees). There are bamboos, palms, vines, and spiny plants that you meet unexpectedly. There are wild oranges, which are green, and wild limes, which are orange. There are bromeliads - living bowls of water where the treefrogs lay their eggs. All of these plants occur right in front of you, piled on top of each other.  Jackfruit, the largest (and tastiest!) fruit in the world.   Jackfruit, the largest (and tastiest!) fruit in the world. Ficus trees are so charismatic that theyve run for Congress.  Ficus trees are so charismatic that theyve run for Congress. There are also animals, but they are harder to see. Colorful birds flash past you and disappear in the leaves, and if you find a fruit tree you may meet some monkeys. You will definitely meet some mosquitoes. There is a constant hum of insects at any time of the day or night, so perpetual that you dont notice it. Every so often, a screaming flock of parrots dashes across the sky and vanishes in the distance.      Butterflies are cute when they sleep.       Butterflies are cute when they sleep. Moths are very considerate animals; they will come to you if you ask nicely. All you have to do is set up a very bright light  too bright to look at. As night falls, moths flutter in from the surrounding forest and flap around the light with determined fascination. They land on the bulb, on the ground, in your hair. Some are tiny, no bigger than flies. Others are the size of bats. Many are experts at camouflage, rolling up their wings to look like twigs, dropping to the grass as leaves, or blending in with the bark of the trees. So many moths! So little time to photograph them! And they are all moving at once in a blur of patterns and colors.You stay up all night, sleep the next day, then do it all over again.

This harlequin beetle was too big to fit on my hand. This harlequin beetle was too big to fit on my hand. After three weeks in Paradise, I returned to Boston laden with gigabytes of photos, which I slowly identified over the course of a year. REGUA has started a moth database to be used by entomologists around the world. Theres a lot more out there, but its a start.With the help of MISTI, I flew back this year during IAP. January is the wet season in Brazil, and it rains a lot. Next to every building is a deep groove in the concrete caused by water falling off the roof. Moths like to go out in the heaviest downpours. I dont. But anything in the interests of science, right?Together with Sue Loose, a dragonfly expert, I spent a week in the mountains, where the most exotic moths are to be found. On New Years Eve, we visited a peak called Caledonia, about 6,500 feet high. Thats taller than any mountain in the eastern US, but at the Equator it could still be warm and vibrant with life.Even in the rainforest, of course, you dont get to spend all your time watching fireworks from a mountain. There are afternoons lugging heavy equipment along a trail. Hours on a patchy wifi network, pleading with Google to tell you what your species is. You learn to deal with unforeseen calamities, the vicissitudes of an environment where you really arent in control.Confusion - when you discover a bat in your bathroom.Frustration - when a gigantic yellow moth appears and is eaten by owls before you can get a photo of it. IT ATE OUR MOTH. (Photo by Sue Loose.)  IT ATE OUR MOTH. (Photo by Sue Loose.) Sue says that the red-eye function simply doesnt work on owls.Despair - when you drop your special moth light and it shatters into tiny pieces.Pain  when you discover you are standing in a swarm of army ants.Panic - when you have set up camp outside a school in a remote valley and manage to set off the burglar alarm in the middle of the night. Will you be able to convince the police that you were just looking for moths?But if Ive learned one lesson, its this: If you truly care about something and persist in working towards it, sometimes it magically happens. Remember your dreams, because they may not be as far off as you think.  i'm from albany, california, which is a tiny square mile and a half next to berkeley, california. as a result, i say hella... hella. my life goal is to be on extreme couponing: all-stars. my other life goal is to avoid being on hoarders: buried alive. i... read more  see complete archives  I'll be honestI had never really planned on going abroad during college. Not even for a bit! (I'm starting to think I'm always more homesick than I realized...) It's a preposterous idea considering how many opportunities MIT churns out every year to send my friends everywhere from DC (okay, that's not really abroad!) to London to Paris to Seoul... I just figured it wouldn't be the worst thing if I stayed a little closer to home. Earlier this semester I committed to taking CMS.634, Designing Interactions. The class, taught by the director of the Media Lab's Mobile Experience Lab, is small, demanding and moves incredibly quickly. Each semester the class works with a different client to learn and apply ideas about interaction design to either improve an existing solution or address an unresolved need. It's a class that ends up sprawling across multiple disciplines, so a unique mixture of architecture, computer science, design and media studies students are thrown together for a semester to work in interdisciplinary teams. This semester the class enrollment was especially limited for two reasons: 1) We would be working on designing an application for Google Glass, and each team of two would be working with their own pair of Glass..es? Google Glass glasses? Goog- whatever 2) After the 6th week, the class would be flown to Istanbul for a week to present to the sponsor companyall expenses paid.  Still, I was hesitant. The trip was scheduled for the week before Spring Break. I had never really anticipated on replacing a block of my calendar with a trip to Istanbul, and didn't feel 100% comfortable about it until I caught up with Anastassia B. '16 just before the trip. Anastassia and I got onto the topic of how we perceive money as something that could buy X amount of Y. I told her I always jokingly see money in units of XBox 360s (a trip to Istanbul? that's like, 9 XBox 360s!) and she humored me. But then she told me that she sees money in how much distance it can buy you. She sees money as a way to unlock the ability to travel across the worldmy head nearly exploded trying to process that idea. It was amazing and foreign and scary and perfectly reasonable at the same time. I committed to the class and last week was one of the most fascinating and grueling experiences of my life. Even though there was no pretense about the amount of work that still had to be done on the trip, I still anticipated 400% more Turkish Delight and 300% fewer hours spent trying to manage my school life (alas, school didn't stop for me while I was away) and my temporary Istanbul work life. While our work is still under wraps until the end of the semester, it's safe to say that we're on track to have a gorgeous Google Glass app. :)           And for the first time in my life, I underpacked. It's another scary feelingI always thought I wouldn't be able to find what I needed at my destination. I wasn't giving myself enough credit! One of my favorite classes this year is CMS.100 -- Introduction to Media Studies, taught by Ian Condry. He's a cultural anthropologist; his latest book, The Soul of Anime, examines the notion of "collaborative creativity" in the context of Japanese anime production and propagation through worldwide fan communities. The idea is, people tend to think of media as having one or a small group of "authors" or "creators"; we associate Spirited Away with Hayao Miyazaki, Harry Potter with J. K. Rowling, Portal with Valve, Beyonce with Beyonce. But it's actually the case that creative production is an intensively collaborative process, whether that means long meetings with production staff to determine the feel and atmosphere of a new film or the wide variety of fan-produced content ranging from fanart to fan fiction to fan-mixed anime music videos (AMVs) to cosplay. From the professional producers all the way down to the fans, there's a creative energy that drives and develops the "universe" of a media phenomenon--as Condry calls it, the "soul" of anime.  This is one of my favorite classes because--let's face it--media is everywhere, through Facebook and TV shows and every web site and textbook and advertisement pasted on the side of a bus. Having a dedicated 5+ hours/week to really grapple with topics like how advertising is changing in the 21st century (two words: big data), how fan culture and fan production works for no good economic reason, why and how viral content goes viral, and so on--it really changes the way you go about your life. I've found myself wondering more about how targeted advertising is placed on my Facebook, or how exactly Twitch Plays Pokemon managed to develop not only a following of millions but also a cultish religion, or how Github has enabled remixing and spoofing of 2048 into expressions of everything from doge derps to college rivalries. And since media is everywhere, this class also means I get to write papers on pretty much whatever I'm interested in--my first paper was a five-page essay about how Valve has empowered amateur fan production in Team Fortress 2.  Another reason this is is one of my favorite classes is that we get to go to events for free. The CMS department sponsored me and a few classmates to go to Anime Boston this weekend to attend my professor's panel talk with the esteemed Dai Sato, anime screenwriter for Cowboy Bebop, Ghost in the Shell, and Samurai Champloo (which is an anime about hip-hop and samurai). Professor Condry, being fluent in Japanese, translated for Sato as Sato talked about how he became a screenwriter and his philosophy of writing.  One thing Sato said about writing stuck with me: "If you want to be a writer, you have to write--but it also helps if you have another skill to draw from and incorporate into your writing." For Sato, that other skill was music and songwriting; he described writing lyrics as a process of matching words to a rhythm, which he uses as inspiration for writing the dialogue in his scripts. Anime and music are also similar in that they're constrained by time--a 3 minute song, a 30-minute anime episode--and there is a challenge to managing that time in the best way possible. Finally, Sato draws from music to create the atmosphere and feel of an anime; for instance, his work for Eureka 7 is heavily influenced by techno music, and Cowboy Bebop has a distinct jazz flavor.  Another thread of discussion focused on Sato's current work with a series called Space Dandy. Space Dandy is heavily influenced by the 1970s and 1980s (though it's set in the future, characters still use boom boxes, cassette tapes, and computers with punch cards). The 70s and 80s were also what some describe as a "golden age" for anime--series like Gundam and Lupin III gained global popularity and gave anime an unprecedented and very unexpected worldwide audience. Sato commented that like fashion, like music, anime seems to have a 20 or 30-year cycle; but since anime only made it big in the 1970s and 80s, the industry is only now going back and drawing inspiration and influence from that original golden-age work. Space Dandy also seeks to challenge the increasing trend of moe anime, so-called "cute little girl anime." As Sato said, with moe it's now often true that you don't really need a story; just the feel and the atmosphere. Space Dandy is attempting to push back a little by exploring deeper topics and taking the artistic style in a more mature direction.  After the panel, our group wandered through the Artists' Alley and the Dealers' Room, where all sorts of artists and craftspeople were selling their wares. Prints of everything from Elsa from Frozen to Sherlock slash pairings, plush My Little Pony beanies, bookmarks, postcards, t-shirts everywhere. It was a veritable visual explosion of colors and fandoms mixing together. Couple in the cosplayers, and you get quite a scene; picture Data from Star Trek: TNG browsing through the Rise of the Guardians prints with Princess Bubblegum from Adventure Time while a whole group dressed as Batman villains gets asked for a photograph by somebody dressed as Loki. That's another thing--everyone is ridiculously nice. The people on the down escalators reach over to their neighbors on the up escalators for high-fives as they pass each other, and every few minutes you can hear somebody saying "you look so pretty!" or "that costume looks badass! nice job!" to somebody else. The sense of fan community is really apparent--it's one thing to read about collaborative creativity in my professor's book, but it's quite another to actually attend a con and see what the fandom is like in-person. We wrapped up the night by heading to Chinatown and sitting down for some good old scallion pancakes and fried rice and Chinese broccoli for dinner, stopping by a bakery for roll cake and egg tarts afterwards. Boston is beautiful at night, doubly so when you're with friends, and triply so when you and your friends are in full cosplay. Sure, you get some odd looks--but you also get compliments. One of my friends was in a blond wig (dressed as Kise from Kuroko no Basuke) and got stopped multiple times by people saying how pretty her hair was. I was thankfully in a less noticeable outfit, as I'd updated my Princess Luna costume from Halloween with the help of a sewing machine I recently began learning to use. The MIT Maker culture is thriving, and it doesn't just refer to making robots and hacking together webapps. Clothes count too! So that kicks off spring break--I'll probably be in lab all week with the Design/Build/Fly team as competition day approaches on the weekend of April 11-13. I can't say much yet--for competition's sake, the airplane's design is a closely guarded secret--but expect blog posts about it soon :) Allan see complete archives         Juliet Capulet, portrayed by Chelsea R. 15 and photographed by Emily K.-L. 16. About a week ago I sat down with one my best friends Chelsea R. 15 to talk about one of her favorite classes, Writing for Social Media, and the universe it comes from. I deeply respect Chelsea for building a career out of her true passions, even though the road hasnt been paved, and I wish Id known older her when I was a younger me. Im excited to be able to share some of her insights with you. I also hope her online work can be a helpful distraction for those of you who are waiting on more college admissions decisions (and/or maybe happen to like Sherlock). Lydia: Okay. Who are you and what are you doing in my house? Chelsea: Um, well, Im Chelsea. Im a junior in course 21E. 21E is something that not a lot of people know exists. 21E (Humanities and Engineering) and 21S (Humanities and Science) are the joint majors; theyre the majors where you squish humanities and science disciplines together. My joint major is between comparative media studies (CMS) and course 6, computer science. I am in your house because you, uh, invited me here. L: Tell me about your Writing for Social Media class. C: Writing for Social Media (CMS.613/21W.751) isIdont know where else you could find a class like it. Its about social media strategy as well as producing stuff for social mediaand stuff is all kinds of stuff. The first portion of the class focused on projecting an image out into the Internet. The focus was looking at how other people personalized their social media images and how brands did it. Then we had to create our own goals and tweet at least five times a day to project some kind of image. I made one focusing more on my goals of eating healthy and keeping fit during a stressful semester. Were all figuring out how to project a consistent image online. The posting has to be regular, which is really important when it comes to social media. The second phase of the class is adaptive Internet stuff. We are doing group projects that adapt some kind ofI think all three of the groups are adapting some kind of extant thing and making it into a Twitter, uh, thing. One group is doing the first season of Battlestar Gallactica. The characters of Battlestar Gallactica are going to be tweeting as if they are going through the first season of Battlestar Gallacticabut with Twitters. Itll sound very, very familiar if youve ever heard of fanfiction. In a way, it is fanfiction, but there are constraints that Twitter offers as a medium for storytelling that make it a very different environment. And then in the third phase we get to do whatever kind of creative project we want butagainTwitter. Right now were all hard at work on our adaptive projects. Those will post throughout March and through the first week of April. L: Tell me about your particular adaptation and the creative work that you are putting into it. C: Its a group project, so its me and its two other students, Gustavo and Taylor. And theyre both wonderful. We decided to adapt Romeo and Juliet for Twitter. Immediately you go, Oh, Romeo and Juliet, everyone knows that story! But there is a reason its still around and were still talking about it, and we continue to study it in school. We are bringing it to Twitter. We tossed around a couple of ideas. Theres one kind of Twitter adaptation that was exemplified by, like, Mad Men roleplayers on Twitter. Mad Men is set in the sixties, and in the sixties you dont have Twitter. That doesnt really matter! Theyre tweeting, from the sixties. We considered doing that with Romeo and Juliet but then we decided to sort of update it instead. Of course there have been updates of Romeo and Juliet. We wanted to do something different, so we changed the conflict around a little bit. And the way were going to tweetthe way were going to treatL: [laughter]C: their Twitters is as if theyre actual people going about their actual lives. They tweet about their days and they tweet about whats happening to them and if some super-dramatic thing is happening in the plot they will not be online to tweet about it. Because thats not how real life necessarily works. (Um, it does work that way for some people.) The fight scene between Tybalt and Mercutio? If Romeos trying to get in the middle of them to stop them from fighting, hes not going to be tweeting about itOMG guys, cut it out!hes going to be conspicuously absent for a period of a couple of hours. If he is being accused of murder he is going to be conspicuously absent for a very long time because he does not want anyone to find him. One of the questions that we sat down and we asked ourselves was, why Twitter? Of course the obviousanswer is because we have to use Twitter for this project. But there should be another reason behind doing any kind of storytelling on any social media platform. Why this platform? What affordances does this platform have and what limitations does it have that make it ideal for telling this story this way? We wanted to get the Internet involved. The thing about Romeo and Juliet is obviously its a very secret relationship: its kept from parents, its kept from the eyes of authority. Where do teenagers keep things from other people? The Internet, right? So thats the direction we decided to go. Of course we also made a few other changes. We aged up Juliet. She is now a high school senior. Applying to college! Well, shes waiting to hear back from colleges. Her parents want her to go abroad to the University of Paris. Shes not sure about it. But she is actually growing up in a college town, fair Verona City, USA. The university in the town is Montague State University. They have a lot of frats and rowdy frat boys. One of the rowdy frat boys is Romeo. If these two people met in real lifefirst of all, they wouldnt. Juliets father is the mayor and he does not want her hanging around these college boys. He doesnt like them very much. They cause a lot of public disturbances. L: As college boys do. C: As college boys do. But online, if they find each other and start talking, there are no limitations...especially if their names arent on their profiles. Well, their last names. And their fraternity affiliations. You understand. Theres nothing to get in the way of that relationship blossoming online, whereas real life factors would have kept them from ever even meeting.L: I think its beautiful that in the same way that Twitter facilitates the relationship of Romeo and Juliet in this adaptation, Twitter and social media facilitate the storytelling and the connection between fans and these stories. C: The thing about telling a story on any form of social media is that it allows the potential for interactivity. The characters in Romeo and Juliet in this adaptation are not just going to be following each other. Theyre going to be citizens of the world. If people talk to them, they might talk back. No promises, but its possible! You know, um, Mercutio, who is, a crazy character, is gonna follow, like, Kim KardashianL: [laughter]C: and Miley Cyrus, you know. L: I follow Miley Cyrus and Kim Kardashian. C: You follow Miley Cyrus and Kim Kardashian. Um. His profile is really funny, by the way. His, um, profile picture is a little bit inappropriate. His display name is Mercuti-YOOOO. L: [laughter] C: So, uh, definitely check that one out. That is probably my favorite of the bunch. And Taylor, whos primarily responsible for writing tweets for him, is very funny. Not only can people talk to the characters, we as writers have to dig into what they do on a day to day basis because people dont only tweet when dramatic things are happening to them. Hopefully that should flesh out the characters and make them more relatable to a wider audience. L: How did you arrive at CMS? How did you find yourself gravitating toward it? C: CMS as a department has an incredible amount of variance in it.A lot of people gravitate towards CMS because theres a lot of things in there about video gameswriting for video games, making video games. What Im interested in is fan cultures, Internet studies, and things like that: writing for the Internet. Its definitely a department that I recommend people check out. People arent necessary aware of their options when it comes to picking a good concentration or even a minor. Theres a lot of opportunity at MIT to open up and explore things you havent explored yet. I think CMS is a great department for that. I wish Id realized it existed when I was a freshman. When I came to MIT I was determined to be course 6, which was so silly in retrospect because I always wanted to write and I kind of wanted to be a novelist. But I was a very practical 18-year-old and I also wanted to make sure I could feed myself. I came to MIT with the intention of majoring in in 6-3, graduating, finding a programming job somewhere. And coding during the day and writing at night and being able to feed myself and never having to really worry about that. L: Still kind of my plan. C: Yeah. L: [laughter] C: The thing that I realized as I took my GIRs my freshman year and I took 6.01 (Introduction to Electrical Engineering and Computer Science I) was I couldnt really envision a future for myself that was structured like that. I looked at the writing department and, you know, the writing department here is stellar, but there was still a part of me that was, like, Oh, dont you want to make sure that you can eat? Of course there are plenty of people who graduate with creative writing degrees who can feed themselves, so I started to look at the other things that MIT had to offer and I came across comparative media studies and the class list and the major structure. I was looking at the classes, and I just said, Wow, this is everything I like to do for fun! but as a major! I can study the things I like to do for fun! Something that I would recommend to everyone is to pursue something that you really love, because it will make your life so much more meaningful. L: Could you tell me about how this connects to someof the work youve been doing outside of your classes? C: Since its a relatively new thing that Im pursuing, Ive only done a couple of internships. I did two internships in LA this summer. One for a PR company, one for a production company, both in their digital departments. I came into that fresh off of taking Fans and Fan Cultures (CMS.621/CMS.821), which is another excellent CMSclass that I really recommend. L: What did you do there? C: I worked a little bit on transmedia stuff for the production company. Transmedia is telling stories across different platforms. I ended up doing tie-in stuff for one of the series they were helping produce. For the PR company I did a lot involving developing digital strategies for the company's clients. They were two very different experiences; they were very different work environments. But I learned a lot there, I made a lot of connections, and it actually led directly to the internship I did last semester and which Im continuing to do this semester. It was different from what my course 6 friends did over the summer. Most of them were at, you knowone of my friends was up in Seattle at Microsoft, and living in a house and getting paid an exorbitant amount of money working at Microsoft and I was sleeping on an air mattress on my cousins floor in her one-bedroom apartment, in Hollywood. Um, andL: Sounds so romantic.C: living off of my savingsso romanticand money Id won in a writing contest at MIT the previous semester. Uh, super romantic. Definitely. I feel like its one of those typical East Coast girl goes to Hollywood, tries to make it experiences except I wasnt trying to become an actress. L: Could you tell me a little about the internship that youre continuing this semester? C: Im working for this company called The Alchemists. They work on transmedia production, transmedia strategy. Theyve done stuff for Coke and they did a series of commercials for Marvel Comics. Theyre currently working on a Hulu exclusive series called East Los High about teenagers in LA. Im mostly helping them with their social media outreach right now. Their companys all about expanding properties onto other platforms and theyre trying to get more of themselves online, too. Im kind of the Tumblr intern. Tumblr is the platform I probably use the most. (Or it was, at least until I had to start using Twitter at least five times a day for Writing for Social Media this semester.) Ive been writing, Ive been helping them update their Tumblr, Ive been writing blog posts for the Tumblr, generally about fans, fan cultures, social media, and how the powers that beas we call theminteract with social media. I did one last week about the show Hannibal, and how Hannibals Tumblr is just so on point. Its exciting. Im learning a lot. And its generally pretty manageable with all of my other responsibilities this semester. L: Could you tell me about storytelling through social media and how itschanged fandom? C: Fans have been telling stories online for a very long time. Id say even some of your casual readers probably know about FanFiction.netthat would sound familiar. Archive of Our Own is the current, uh, quality archive out there. Roleplaying has also always been a big thing. Forums, LiveJournal, uh, and you could call those I guess media facilitated storylines because I think of roleplaying as interactive writing thats kind of more on the spot. I run a blog with a co-author, Sethwho is amazingthat is a work of fanfiction but its interactive because its on Tumblr and the plot is moved forward by question answering. So people submit questions to the characters, the characters will answer, and sometimes theyll just answer in a way thats funny or meaningful, and sometimes theyll say something and it opens up a whole new door into a plotline. And its awesome! When youre chronicling characters daily lives its a lot easier to fill in the gaps. On a TV show thats a crime procedural you mostly only see crime procedural stuff. Youll sometimes get a few minutes of character backstory and looks into what they do every day but not much. Now if the show completely changed course and became, you know, focused on the domestic lives of characters, obviously that would not be what that show would want to do. Through social media its possible to get more of a look into the gaps that the original story doesnt fill in. Fans do this, but like, official powers can also do this. Like, itsits very effective. It makes your characters seem like theyre actual people living in the modern world. I know that for East Los High one of the characters had a vlog and one of the characters who cooked had their recipes posted online. That makes the world seem real: by bringing it onto the Internet, or onto whatever other platform, you're forced to expand the world. And it forces you to expand your characters, too. L: Could you tell me about some of the successful uses of social media by companies that do storytelling? C: Go look at The Alchemists. Theyre awesome. Also, one of the primary examples of this is of course The Lizzie Bennet Diaries. Are you familiar with The Lizzie Bennet Diaries? L: No. C: Okay, so The Lizzie Bennet Diaries is a little bitwe drew a little bit of inspiration from this for our Romeo and Juliet Twitter project. Its an updating and an adaptation of Pride and Prejudice. The main medium through which the story was communicated was YouTube vlogs. Lizzie Bennet had a YouTube channel, and she would do vlogs, and she would invite other people from her life to come on to the vlogs, and, you know, updated versions of the events from Pride and Prejudice started happening. You could just follow the YouTube account and it would totally be fine. You would get a complete story. If you wanted a more complete story, all of the characters had social media accounts. Some of them had Twitters, some of them had Tumblrs, and they interacted with each other. So it wasnt just the vlogs, which I believe came out twice weekly, that told the story. You could watch the vlogs and you would get a complete story. But for a more complete story you could go and read Elizabeth Bennets Twitter. You know? Casual. There are some other properties that have successfully expanded into social media, not from a storytelling perspective but from a fan galvanization perspective. Whether or not youre interested in telling stories online, I think everybody should be getting on that train. Online presences are so important, especially when youre trying to reach the key demographic that most movies and TV shows want to reach (young people). The traditional television format and traditional movies, the way were used to them, is not always the way that its going to be. More and more things are ending up online and things that would have been indie are ending up with wider audiences. As things get progressively disseminated, its going to be increasingly important to draw people in. Again, online storytelling is a really good way to do this. Its something that makes you stand out to fans. I think that more and more storytelling is going to move online. Not necessarily through social media but, you already know, binge watching through Netflix is a thing. Amazon Prime and Netflix and Hulu and all their exclusive online series. I think theyre only the beginning of the trend. L: Tell me about your dreams and plans for the future. C: Theyre a little undecided as of yet. I have an idea, and the idea is that I really want to go into this stuff. Im passionate about storytelling, Im passionate about the digital, and so digital storytelling is really about the best of both worlds. I do want to tell my own stories. I love writing. I would love to write a novel. L: It really feels like youve already written several. C: Doesnt it? It does to me, a little bit. The answer is yes. I feel like they wouldnt be considered novels because a lot of them are either published online or theyre derivative worksfanfictionor theyre both. I undertook an extremely expansive project with Seth to fill in the gaps of the TV show Sherlock. That was the question and answer blog that I mentioned. People would come in and they would ask questions to Watson and Holmes, and I would respond as Watson and Seth would respond as Holmes and we would shoot the response out there into the world. And sometimes if that wasnt enough to explain what was going on with them we would write thousands and thousands and thousands of words to fill in the scenes.   L: The blogs actually gotten very popular, hasnt it? C: Yeah, the blog has a lot of followers. I dont want to brag. L: You can brag. Its okay. C: The blog haswe hit 14,000 a few days ago. Its really exciting. Its sad because Im also having a little bit of trouble finding time to update regularly with my crazy semester schedule but were working on it still. Because the new season of Sherlock came out, that means there is new stuff to exploreL: New gaps to fill in. So many gaps!C: Lets not get into that! But we did give the entire second season of Sherlock this treatment. And I dont even know how many thousands of words we wrote in total. We had probably something like 800 questions and answers, along with a number of prose interludes, and the prose interludes could run thousands of words long. There were 16 what we would call interludes. There were four or five flashbacks, which could be about the same length. There were several transcripts from telephone conversations. All this, um, its basically an insane amount of writing. And it was collaborative between Seth and me, and also between us and the fans. Because the people who read the blog submit questionsyou know, one of them submitted a question from a character we had not even considered incorporating into the story but who became a major player just because someone sent an ask.  L: You dont usually have the power to change the story as youre reading it. Thats really special. C: I think its a way to give back to the people who read. Because they can make a huge difference. I think that a lot of successful people have already sort of figured that out. You know, be good to your fans and theyll be good to you. But this takes it to a whole new level. Its okay to not have 300% control. You can still have a vision. You can still follow that vision. But your vision always has room for alterations. And improvisation. And thats what makes it fun. Thats what were hoping to do with the Romeo and Juliet project. We do have a general outline for how the events are going to go and be adapted. But if someone starts talking to Juliet about physics class, you know, they can talk to Juliet about physics class. Shes in AP Physics. L: Can you help me with my physics homework, Juliet? C: Yeah. You know, and then Juliet can talk to someone about Gausss Law. It could happen! Its not bound. Its a flexible storytelling environment. You guys should all read! You should all read Romeo and Juliet. You know, follow the blog! Read the story. If its not your thing, just drop the story. If it is your thing, you know, ask Juliet about your physics homework. Tell Romeo hes being silly mooningover a girl he hasnt met in real life. Uh. Recommend some music to Mercutio. Send him pictures of big booties. Dontdont publish that. He likes the booty. I mean, but theyretheyre here to be followed but theyre also here to be talked to. And you never know! They might reply. Follow and interact with the characters Twitters here: Alternatively, follow the syndicated list here or a daily digest of tweets on the Tumblr. Have fun! I hope youre all getting excited for Campus Preview Weekend coming up in April (sign up now)! Since I know you just cant wait to meet other new MIT admits I want to let you know about some exciting opportunities for Admitted Students coming up in cities around the globe within the next few days. Weve been working with our fantastic Educational Counselors and other great alumni to put together admitted student gatherings to help welcome you to MIT. Beginning this Saturday, MIT alumni from around the world will host parties in their hometowns for students admitted to the class of 2018. If theres an event in your area, you should check it out  theyre a great opportunity to meet some potential future classmates, as well as MIT students and alumni. I still remember the one I attended in the Bay Area of California in the spring after I was admitted to MIT! Here are a few highlighted events this coming week; see your MyMIT portal for the locations and times of these events, and for a comprehensive list of all of the events. Saturday Sunday Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday But these are just a few so be sure to check the listing on your MyMIT account for the most up to date information and RSVP if requested. There is a whole MIT community that cant wait to meet you. Congratulations and welcome!  You: Where are you from?Me: London.You: But you...you don't...you don't seem to have a British accent.Me: Correct. Let me explain! I was born in Singapore, had a Singaporean accent, then moved to London during the summer before fifth... read more  see complete archives  14 billion years ago (ish), the universe Banged and rapidly expanded. What started as tiny quantum fluctuations also expanded, clumped, and became the structures that we see today. One such large-scale structure is the Virgo galaxy cluster, of which the Milky Way is a member. We, of course, live in the Milky Way, although it's hopeless to try and see that dusty stripe of stars from Boston. Today, as you probably already know, there's Big Science News: we're a huge leap closer to understanding exactly what happened in the first moments of the universe. And word on the street is that this could mean a Nobel Prize for MIT's Prof. Alan Guth. - My first interaction with Alan Guth was fraught with stress and in retrospect a bit impolite. It happened a little over three years ago, when I took my first final exam at MIT. He was proctoring a different exam (relativity) but I didn't know the difference, so when the TAs skipped over my section by accident I marched up to him and said "Hello, my section did not receive any exam booklets." Prof. Guth smiled and asked whether I was in the right exam hall. Bristling at the suggestion that I could have wandered into the wrong exam hall, I said "Um, yes. 8.012 is DEFINITELY in this building, and we DEFINITELY do not have exams." He said oh, okay, and hurried off to find exam booklets for me. Twenty seconds later, I had a fangirl freakout when gears in my brain clicked and I realized who I'd been speaking to. A few months later, I declared a major in physics, and indicated on my advisor selection form that I was very interested in theoretical physics and cosmology (very cute, since in retrospect I realize that I had no idea what any of those words meant). Sometime over the summer, I received an e-mail saying that "Professor Alan Guth has agreed to serve as your advisor. Please use him as a resource for helping you make the most of your time at MIT, and for working towards completion of your Physics degree. Please do stop by and see your advisor on registration day." and I had my second Alan Guth-themed freakout: slammed my computer shut only to immediately re-open it to e-mail my mom, sprinted outside to tell everyone and nearly broke my face on the screen door, and wrote a blog post.  Soon, we were e-mailing back and forth to schedule a class registration meeting (as my advisor, he helps me to come up with an appropriate schedule and signs off on my class registration forms). He signed his e-mails "Alan," and I had a vigorous internal debate about whether that meant it was okay to start my e-mails with "Dear Alan" instead of "Dear Professor Guth." Is it ever appropriate to address A Famous Person by first name?! I e-mailed him to ask. "Yes," he wrote back, "I am happy to have my students and advisees call me Alan." That semester, I took a class taught by Alan: 8.286, The Early Universe. It was a great privilege to learn about inflationary theory from the man who came up with it. Sometimes, one hears about Famous Professors who have zero interest in pedagogy, but Alan isn't like that at all. In office hours one day, he mentioned these crazy things called cosmic strings -- I was so fascinated that I asked him to tell us more about them, and he offered to hold an entire extra session for the class. So, one evening, a group of us sat in a tiny conference room while Alan Guth stood at the board and blew our minds. Fast forward to my junior fall. That was my roughest semester. I spent all my time on Junior Lab and learned that experimental work is My Thing, yet got my butt kicked by 8.05 (Quantum II) which sent me on a downward spiral of insecurity. I remember sitting in Alan's office (surrounded by empty cans of Diet Coke...that guy has a Diet Coke problem) nearly in tears, mortified at the idea of having to discuss that academic disaster with the recent winner of a $3 million physics prize. The first thing he said was "I know you can do better," and then we worked together to come up with a plan for how to move forward. He (along with Dumbledore) helped me put together my Quantum Rehab Program, which consisted of grading for Quantum I and writing lecture notes for Quantum II. On my way out the door, I congratulated him on his $3 million prize and asked if would have our advising meetings in fancy restaurants from now on -- he was amused. Anyway, I'm now taking Quantum III, and feeling comfortable with that material. One of my proudest moments at MIT has been: sitting down in Alan's office at the beginning of my senior spring semester, and telling him about my graduate school acceptances. He wrote me letters of recommendation for nearly all of my grad school and fellowship applications (which is a tale of adventure in itself: Alan is reliable and has always submitted my letters on time, but also reliably submits things JUST in time -- I have had some 11:59 PM freakouts. Oh well. Keeps things interesting, I guess?) and was really excited for me. After my 8.05 troubles, after wondering whether I was really cut out to be a scientist, having graduate schools confirm that they do in fact believe I ought to become a professional astronomer and being able to relay that to Alan meant a lot to me. Today, Alan became famous, again. As you're probably aware if you use the Internet, John Kovac and his team at Harvard just discovered "smoking gun" evidence for inflation: experimental support for the theory that Alan developed decades ago. It's a HUGE deal, albeit a little confusing. You've heard of the Big Bang, yes? Inflation refers to the period immediately following that, in which (according to Alan) the universe expanded at a mind-boggling rate. If this theory is correct, then gravitational waves ("ripples in spacetime") should have been emitted during that period. Scientists have not yet directly detected gravitational waves (that's what the LIGO project at MIT is all about) but so far indirect measurements have been consistent with gravitational wave theory. In the 1980s, for example, a Nobel Prize went to pulsar astronomers (WOOOOO! PULSARS!) for indirectly measuring gravitational wave emission. This time, Kovac & co made another indirect measurement of gravitational waves, but this time gravitational waves from the primordial universe. Essentially, they found exactly what Alan's theory predicted. MIT's physics department has a very high density of Famous Physicists. Yet, I have found very consistently over the past three years that it also has a high density of physicists who are dedicated to undergraduate pedagogy. If I had gone to another school, I might have stuck with my original neuroscience interests and become a doctor -- here at MIT, though, this is the department in which I feel both highly intellectual stimulated and personally comfortable and supported. I really cannot say enough good things about my experiences in Course 8.  So, today, MIT and the astronomy community are abuzz with excitement: I've been getting e-mails from friends, had a few shrieking phone conversations, and there are a lot of universe expansion images on my Facebook newsfeed. Fingers crossed for that Nobel Prize. In any case, I'm glad that I'm such an indecisive student: I end up adding and dropping a couple of classes every semester, so I have accumulated many copies of Alan Guth's signature. Every year we publish a FAQ about the waitlist. Students on the waitlist have lots of questions, so hopefully you find an answer to yours here. How does the waitlist work?We are aiming for a class of about 1050 students this year. Based on our estimates of the percentage of admitted students who will attend (known as the "yield"), we admitted 1419 students. However, it isn't possible to exactly predict how many students will attend this year. To help with the uncertainties, we also keep a waitlist of students. Is the waitlist ranked?No. How many people are on the waitlist?We offered approximately 3% of applicants a spot on the waitlist. Not all of those students will choose to remain on the waitlist. Can you tell me where I am on the waitlist?No, because it's not ranked. We will reconsider all of the waitlisted students again in May, when we know how many students remain on the waitlist, and how many we wish to take from the waitlist. How many people will you admit from the waitlist this year?It is impossible to know. We will have no idea how many people, if any, we will take from the waitlist until the first or second week of May. What has the waitlist looked like, historically?In the last five years, we have admitted as few as 0 students from the waitlist and as many as 78 students. However, it's impossible to know what will happen this year, since we dont yet know what the exact yield will be this year. Can you tell me where my application was lacking, or what I should improve on?If we waitlisted you, it means we really like you, and you do not need to improve on your application. You should, however, continue to get good grades, as we may call your school to check on your academic progress. What are the realities here?True story: it's likely that most people on the waitlist will not be admitted. But remember, any statistic against you (or for you) is associative but not causal. This means, what has happened in the past or on any other application doesn't impact your application. Whom do you admit from the waitlist? For example, if someone from state X or major Y declines, are you likely to look for another student like them?Sometimes we look at things like that but we're not strict about it. So, if a foosball champion decides to go somewhere else, we may, or may not, go out of our way to try to find another foosball player on the waitlist. It just depends on what the list looks like. Are domestic students given priority over international students on the waitlist?No, but we do consider whether admitting international students from the waitlist would put us over our international quota. If I'm waitlisted, can I still come for CPW or do the Overnight Program?No, I'm sorry. I'm still very interested in attending MIT. What should I do if I hope to be admitted from the waitlist?A waitlist confirmation form will be available online in early April. After youve heard back from all the colleges youve applied to, please use the form to let us know whether you wish to remain on the waitlist or not. Once its live, well email you to let you know. The deadline to complete the form is April 25, 2014. Next, be sure to enroll in a college/university by May 1. You do not need to submit additional documents, but if you would like to, you can email mitwl [at] mit [dot] edu and the documents will be added to your application. Excessively emailing us will not help your case (and might hurt it). I would recommend sending us a note (no more than a page in length) to mitwl [at] mit [dot] edu in mid-late April with an update on what you've been up to since our last contact. You can also feel free to provide any other information you think would be helpful. What should I not do?Here are some things you should not do: Fly to campus to make the case in person. Send us ridiculous items or bribes. Submit a whole new application. Bombard our office with way too much stuff. Be pushy. Be sketchy. Let your grades drop. Not choose another college to attend by May 1. What should I do about the May 1 reply date for other colleges?You should accept the offer of admission from another college before May 1, even if it means making a deposit. After May 1, when all students have sent their replies, colleges will determine if they need to go to their waitlist or not, and if so, how many students they need to admit. At this point, colleges will begin admitting students from the waitlist. Students who accept this offer will "unenroll" at the first college and enroll at the second. This shifting can lead to a second round of waitlist admissions. All of this is a standard part of the admissions process. We colleges recognize and accept this. If I'm admitted off of the waitlist, do I have to go to MIT? What about financial aid?You're not required to enroll. We'll give you a financial aid package and you'll have time to consider your decision before letting us know one way or the other. It is in your best interest to complete your financial aid application now (if you haven't already), so that if you are admitted from the waitlist, we'll have a financial aid package ready to go. Our waitlist process, like our entire admissions process, is need blind, and we will meet full demonstrated need for all admitted students. Okay, what should I do now?First, focus on choosing the best fit college of those who have offered you admission. Waitlists are uncertain, so it is always best to ensure your happiness no matter what the outcome. If you are still interested in MIT, you should stay in contact with us. Drop us a note to mitwl [at] mit [dot] edu once things have calmed down a bit. Please always be very nice in all of your interactions with us! Keep us up to date all the way through May 1 and beyond if you remain interested. And in the meantime... be patient. There won't be any waitlist news until early-mid May. Good luck!  see complete archives  MIT Regular Action admissions decisions for the Class of 2018 are now available at You may log in using the same username and password that you use to log in to your MyMIT account. There are no interim screens, so you should be sure you are ready to receive your decision online before logging in to decisions.mit.edu. 18,357 students applied to the MIT Class of 2018. As of today, and inclusive of Early Action, we have offered admission to 1419. These 1419 students are truly exceptional. The admitted Class of 2018 includes mathematicians and marksmen and metallurgists; coders and carpenters and cosplayers; Texans and Tennesseans and Turkmen. Collectively, they represent all 50 states, more than 50 countries, and more than 1000 high schools; together, they constitute an incredible community, each contributing a set of rare skills and perspectives while holding in common the highest caliber of character, conscientiousness, and, of course, remarkable intelligence.  We often say we dont admit numbers to MIT, we admit people. Yet this isnt quite true either: we admit classes, cohorts which have been curated with great care, each student hand-picked to assemble the best possible team to climb the mountain which is MIT. I have to tell you, this is one hell of a team. Every year I tell myself that this class cannot possibly be more breathtaking than the last; every year they take my breath away. There are also those students who may be climbing other mountains, with other friends, next fall. Of the students to whom we do not offer admission today, we have placed a small number on our waitlist and informed the balance that we will not be able to admit them to the Class of 2018. Turning away so many kind, generous, super-smart young people has been more than difficult: it has been truly painful. If you are among them, then all I can say is that MIT is just another place. If it is amazing, it is amazing not because of some local magic emanating from beneath the Great Dome, but because the people here are amazing. And if you are an amazing person, then you can be amazing wherever you go, if you choose to do so. I'm closing comments on this blog post to concentrate conversation in the open threads for admitted, waitlisted, and not admitted students. We've also posted an article over at MIT News.  Congratulations to the Class of 2018. I wish all of our applicants well. No matter where you enroll next fall, please make it a better place. I know you can. I hope you will.        () Use the comment section below to introduce yourselves!   Because of the incredible size and strength of the applicant pool we were unable to offer admission to many, many incredible students whom we would love to have on campus. However, we did place some students on our waitlist. Tomorrow, March 15th, we will post more information about our waitlist - about how our process works, what you need to do if you are still interested in MIT, and so forth. In the meantime, you may talk amongst yourselves below. As always, please keep your comments civil and friendly in our community. This year was one of the most competitive admissions cycles in the history of the Institute. Because of the incredible size and strength of the applicant pool we were unable to offer admission to many, many incredible students whom we would love to have on campus. For those of you who were not admitted, know that we gave your application full consideration, and that we wish you the very best of luck wherever you choose to continue your education. We have left comments open on this thread so you may talk amongst yourselves. As always, please keep the conversation civil and friendly in our community.  Given that tomorrow is pi(e) day, a celebration of irrational numbers and their homonymous dessert counterparts, lets do a little thought experiment. Lets imagine that one day, a pang of hunger strikes you as though the goddess Limos had inflicted a terrible curse upon you. Well, maybe not THAT bad. This craving is just strong enough to make you go off in search of a bakery for a well-deserved snack. As youre wandering through town, you happen across a little corner shop that looks (and smells) promising. You push open the door and smile as you hear the familiar jingle of a little golden bell. And then you see the dessert case; instead of just the typical two-shelved glass box, this case was filled to the brim with pastriescookies, cakes, tarts, creme brulee. Any sort of savory treat that you could ever dream up was in this case, but one item immediately catches your attention. The pie.  This particular pie looks like it belongs in Platos theory of Forms; it exudes the very essence of what it means to be a pie, and all pies are merely shadows of its perfect image. And you know that this will most definitely satisfy your hankering for something sweet. However, for such a quaint little bakery, theres a huge crowd of people bustling abouteach one trying to catch the attention of the frazzled shopkeeper to put in their order. And it turns out, from the snippets of conversation that you catch from the chaotic rumble of crowd noise, that youre not the only one eyeing that perfect pie.  And with the sheer amount of people there, you realize that some people are going to end up getting a slice of that beautiful pie and taste sweet victory (in this thought experiment, victory = the flavor of your choosing), while others will have to watch the pie run out and be stuck in dessert-limbo, not knowing whether to order something else or hope that theres just one more slice tucked behind a souffle. Not everyone who gets their dream slice of pie will treat it the same. Some gulp it down as fast as possible, enjoying the flavor for a second and moving on to other things. Others attack it with gusto and bite off more than they can chew, before they realize they have to slow down to savor the delicious taste. Some get sick of the pie halfway through and need to take a deep breath before finishing their piece, and a few even decide that they dont want the pie and hand it off to someone else in line.  In this moment, all of the hopes overflowing from your heart and mind are geared towards obtaining a slice of this pie. It seems as though you've been dreaming of pie for days, and this dessert is the only thing that could ever satisfy your cravings. But you get so discouraged just by looking at the people around you, all equally hungry, living equally complicated and interesting and wonderful lives.  As much as you desire that pie, as close as you are to tasting it, you must reassure yourself that the world will not end if you dont get a slice. Even though it would feel like a crushing defeat with the waves of hunger washing over your crumpled form (perhaps a minor exaggeration), not getting a slice of the perfect pie doesnt mean that youre any less deserving of it or of any dessert. You just had a lot of competition from equally ravenous people.  If you dont get a slice, you may be at a loss for a moment. As soon as you turned your laser-focus on that pie, you forgot that all other desserts existed. Or you may deny that any dessert could taste even remotely close to the hypothetical flavor of that sweet, sweet pie. But eventually, youll gather your wits, take another good thorough look at the dessert case, and try a different treat. Perhaps youll still have a pang of regret now and then that you couldnt try a morsel of that pie, but maybe youll find that youre more of a cinnamon roll person anyway.  UAG(in which Ceri attempts to make a terrible bio joke) Hows that for a thought experiment? Hungry for some pie? (My victory/curl up into a puddle underneath a blanket/anytime flavor is mixed berry.) Maybe you got something else out of that story too? Eh. Dont think too much about it. Go chill, grab a snack, watch some Pushing Daisies, or a video of your favorite technical college admissions blogger crew being assaulted with food. Zone out and play with a website (or try one of these other ones), read something that inspires you, or thank someone who always cheers you up. (Oh, and best of luck )  I can see the end of my first reading season from here, and it has been a humbling experience. I am full of gratitude to you, our class of 2018 applicants, for sharing your experiences with us. I have shared your FUN jokes and written them on my whiteboard, I have learned facts and lessons from you, I have cried for you. I had a really horrible physics teacher in high school, and your passion for physics has nudged and encouraged me to try again. I have been delighted by your nerdiness and amazed by your accomplishments, whether academic, athletic, or at home. Unfortunately, even with all that you have taught me, I know that I cannot see you all here next fall. I know that some of you will be disappointed and a dream will have been dashed. In one of the moments that I was thinking about this, this quote from Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince came to mind: At the end of his wits, his mind reeling from all of the bad news doled out to him by both Fudge and Scrimgeour, the Prime Minister cries, "but for heaven's sake  you're wizards! You can do magic! Surely you can sort out  well  anything!" (1.131)."The trouble is, the other side can do magic too, Prime Minister," replies Scrimgeour (1.132). Many people view MIT as a magical place and compare it to Hogwarts. They view the accepted as having magic, or more, than those who are not accepted. People around you may think and even say, Dont those admissions staff wizards know anything? Dont they know you belong there? The troubling thing is they may be right. You get this place. You feel academically and culturally connected to the tute. From the long days in committee that Ive now experienced, I can confirm that we wish we had so much more space than we do in the freshman class for you. I am troubled that if you are disappointed on Friday, that you will begin to see yourself as one without magic. I know that is a lie from Lord Voldemort. The main comparison that I am making is this: accepted or not, you all have the ability to perform magic and you will take that ability with you wherever you go. Thank you again for trusting us with so much of who you are, and I wish you all the best always.  For most of high school, the US was just a vague blip on the radar of my imagination. My friends and I sometimes imagined what the experience of studying in the US would be like, but we spoke in the offhanded, dreamy tone people usually use to describe things like winning the lottery or running for president. I had read one of the MIT blogs once, stumbling onto Annas post, Being Qualified for MIT, but only with distant fascination, fascination because it was such good writing and MIT seemed like such an amazing place, distant because I didnt seriously think that I could attend a university whose site I had stumbled onto from a friends Google search of Worlds Best Universities. And then one morning, towards the end of the first trimester of high school senior year, I was sitting in the library, studying for a Geography exam when someone ran up to me and said I had a package awaiting me in the secretarys office. I rarely received packages of any sort, so I was pretty curious. Not being a cat, I ran quickly to the office and seconds later, was tearing off DHL-branded tape from what appeared to be a thick file. The file was from the University of Pennsylvania, and inside I found several brochures, and a letter. The contents of the letter went along the lines of, You seem like a pretty motivated student; you just might be the kind of student were looking for! We encourage you to seriously consider applying to Penn. It was the first time I had heard of Penn, and my mind hadnt yet been cultured to the term Ivy League or anything of that sort. I knew nothing about the US admissions process, and hadnt been searching, but the idea that a college thousands of miles away would send me mail of this heartwarming sort was unbelievable. I called my parents and more or less ranted about it. I was given rare access to the internet to find out more about Penn. I checked out the universitys website and Wikipedia page. I found CollegeConfidential links to angst-filled posts covering the spectrum of Penn from its prestige to its exclusivity. I did try to think of why they had contacted me. I had taken the SAT nearly a year ago, but that had been routine process for my high school (which was partly owned by the Turkish Government), and only because a bunch of Turkish universities required the SAT. There had also been the AMC and AIME, which I think may have contained some random clause about sharing scores with universities and scholarship organizations. Regardless of the reason, I was glad some university out there seemed interested in me. Deadline was already fast approaching, so I hastily worked on my Common Application, and sent it to Penn within days of their mail. I also sent in my SAT scores and registered for the SAT Subject Tests. I could barely wait the three months to find out the status of my application. In that time, I joined CollegeConfidential, and began to read more about Penn. I found old admit and reject threads and, for the first time since receiving the package, was daunted. My SAT score from 11th grade had been 2080. It was possibly the reason Penn had contacted me, and I was pretty fine with it. But then there were all these amazing scores...2350...2390...even perfect scores...getting rejected or waitlisted. And CollegeConfidential was full of pages upon pages of these drab stories, rejected applicants whose achievements transcended some exam to cover a host of truly amazing feats. It was my first real introduction to the holistic mechanism of the US admissions process, and it created a whirlpool of uncertainty. Did Penn make a mistake? Did Penn really send me that package? It was all I could do to balance my sanity between the fear precipitated by the high scores on the reject threads, and the glimmer of hope induced by the relatively lower scores on some parts of the admit threads. I went back to my application, and with some clarity of mind I must have gained in the past couple of weeks, cringed at some of my essays. To one of them asking why I wanted to be at Penn, I had started thus: I am one of several applicants aspiring to become a member of the prestigious UniPenn (!). To begin, I feel like the resources the university has to offer are unparalleled relative to anything Ive seen before... Was this enough? Would this be enough? It was a little while before Penns decision date when the results for the AMC12  contest were released, and I saw that I had placed at the 99th percentile worldwide, and had qualified to the AIME. I was pretty excited, and after a while, in a realm of elation separate from mere joy at this achievement, I realized that the news could also boost my chances. Excitedly, I sent an e-mail to one of the admissions officers that had contacted me some weeks back, informing him of the news. He replied a few days later, saying that it would be considered with the rest of my application. Awesome! March 29th, 2012 was a Thursday. Penns decision was hours away. The anxiety, the pure, crazy anxiety permeating the pages of CollegeConfidential was this charged cloud you could feel poking your sides. I was tense; I was crazy. I played the will they-wont they game in my mind. I posted like crazy on CC, asking one of the common What are my chances post. Some said I had a decent shot but it was hard to tell. Others said everyone had a low shot. A few were highly cynical of the post itself. All these really just combined to feed the worry. My friends were around me, and they had nothing but positive comments: Youll get in; its you! and Theyll be crazy to reject you! I didnt know what to think, but the closer the decisions came, the more encouraging my friends got, and from their words, a real glimmer of hope emerged. You do have a chance, I told myself. Penn encouraged you to apply!  A while later, I was somehow standing beside my vice-principal while he logged onto Penns website. Drums banged in my chest and throat. Three close friends crowded behind me. I typed in my initials, my hands so shaky it took two tries to get the password right. And text suddenly appeared, text that read: Dear Vincent,After careful review of your application, we are unfortunately unable to offer you admission into Penns class of 2016... My heart calmed. My body went very still. A friend behind me groaned and flung his books. I rose and said in a falsely nonchalant voice, Well, I tried. My friends mumbled words I didnt really hear. I walked out of the office and sadness overwhelmed me.***The week following Penns rejection was long and slow. I was moody. Classes seemed to trudge. I realized that for the past four months, regardless of my fears regarding the Penn outcome, I had absentmindedly imagined myself as a student there, a Penn Quaker, soaking sun in the quad and screaming cheers in the Franklin Field. It didnt seem fair. It didnt seem right. In the weeks that progressed however, what was left of school took over my mind. Writing stories took over my mind. Olympiad classes took over my mind. Penn faded.***I finally convinced myself that Id been indulging in wishful thinking by imagining that I could study in the US. I decided to face my local exams and gain admission into an awesome Nigerian university. Admission into a Nigerian university is different and purely quantitative, depending on a combination of three necessary componentsan exam called WAEC, taken by most West African High school students, a localized examination called JAMB and the concerned universitys own examination (usually called post-JAMB). Due to great restriction on the number of Nigerian universities I could send my JAMB scores to, and a number of post-JAMB conflicts, I only really had one Nigerian university I could apply to, which of course depended on me passing its post-JAMB. So imagine my shock when, at a hotel in Amsterdam for the International Math Olympiad 2012, I decided to check the post-JAMB schedule and saw something quite interesting: the exam was set to take place in about five days. It was the beginning of IMO, and there was clearly no way Id make it back to Nigeria in time. I spoke to my mom in distress about this, but in the sweet, soothing tone that parents often use, she assured me that Id be fine.***Just shortly before graduation, my high school had held an annual Nigerian-Turkish cultural event. Activities bloomed throughout the day, with tasty food on standby for the hungry or tired. My mom came for the event, which was nice since I attended a pretty secluded boarding high school, and rarely got the chance to see her. Towards the end of the day, she made a friend called Mrs. Jimoke. As they chatted about the school, my mom told Mrs. Jimoke about most of the academic things Id been up to, including taking the SAT. Mrs. Jimoke insisted that I reconsider applying to US universities, and gave my mom the contact information of one of her friendsShade Adebayowho worked in an educational sector of the United States Embassy. So after I missed my post-JAMB and after it became clear that I would have to wait at least a few months before I could apply anywhere else, Shade insisted that I apply to US universities. At first I was reluctant, but I realized that a world of possibilities did exist out there, and even if Penn hadnt accepted me, I could probably find some other institution that would. Shade, energetically, vehemently, believed so. I consciously avoided considering extremely selective colleges, and did as much research as I could on the others. Since I was so far away, campus tours and admission information sessions were out of the question. I toured CC, read up several college-related books Shade let me borrow from the US Embassy. I went through websites and Wikipedia pages and more detailed places like Unigo. And I came upon UW-Madison. It had a strong engineering program and a campus that seemed to pulse with unique life. As I became more and more entrenched in UW-Madison, reading up its online newspapers, poring over CC threads, I realized an important difference in the way I was attached to UW-Madison and the way I had been attached to Penn. My obsession with Penn had stemmed from both the strange joy of being reached out to and the beauty of the idea that I could be an undergraduate there. I was overwhelmed by the sense of prestige it possessed and some awareness that it had amazing resources I felt I could only find in few other places. I merely had a general sense of what Penn could be for me, a generality that translated into my barely specific essays. But getting to consciously choose to apply to UW-Madison, I did so on the heels of a more developed sense of what the university and its culture were about. I applied for the Spring 2013 term and was accepted. I was speechless with joy when I saw the letter of acceptance. My parents were jubilant. But of course, there was a problem.***UW-Madison did not offer aid to international students, and my parents would have to pay just a little over forty thousand dollars per year. They assured me that it wouldnt be a problem, but my mom did wonder if I wanted to apply anywhere else. I was somewhat vehement about my choice of UW-Madison, having grown deeply attached to it, and she assured me that as long as I was sure, it was fine. I spoke to Shade afterward. She told me something my mom had confided in her. My parents were willing to pay forty thousand dollars, but it was really money they didnt have. They had begun contemplating possible assets they could sell to fork up some of the money, and the only reason they hadnt divulged this to me had been a result of my endless excitement with the acceptance news. Shade told me that it would be worth it, absolutely worth it, if I could let UW-Madison go in favor of some university, any other university, that wouldnt cost as much. Later that night, I sat alone in my room and thought of my parents willingness to sacrifice that much for my happiness. I thought of how my educational future, once bright and limitless, now seemed and felt infinitely more constrained. I was overwhelmed by weariness and a strange sense of loss. And so I sat on my bed and cried. I cried for a while, and my mom slipped into my room while I lay hunched over, just feeling deflated. She held me really close. She told me things would be alright. She told me that I would end up where I wanted and needed to be, and that she would walk to the ends of the Earth to secure my happiness. I believed her, every word. I held her closer. The next day, I declined UW-Madisons offer of acceptance.***And thats the bulk of it. Thats why I took a gap year. I applied for the fall term to US universities. I meticulously compiled a small list, considering two important personal factorscost and culture. Culture in the sense of its people, culture in the sense of energy, culture in the sense of challenge. I had spent most of high school taking extracurricular olympiad classes that pushed me to work late hours at night. I had felt most ingrained in the learning process when I raced with those challenges constantly, and especially with my classmates. I wanted an environment like that. I wanted an atmosphere built on merit and challenge and collaboration, one that could let me push myself, because I understood I could thrive there.  I also needed a place I could afford. I took the SAT for a second time, attaining a score of 2390. I wrote more, feverishly, stories and novellas and ultimately a novel. I spent that year primarily outside of classes, although I did do a few things   like teaching and attempting to burn down the kitchen cook. I grew closer to my family. I grew closer to myself. More clearly than ever, I began understanding what I wanted. Princeton accepted me Early Action. Harvard rejected me. MIT accepted me on Pi Day, and I will never forget ten words that kept sinking into my mind when I saw that letter of acceptance: We think that you and MIT are a great match. I will never forget the sheer look of joy on my parents face when they saw the letter of acceptance and the immensely generous financial aid offer that had come with it. I will never forget them enclosing me, the world vanishing, for that moment of intimacy to take over, a moment that told me in no uncertain terms that things were fine. Things were good.***Im not really going to talk about CPW or about making the choice of college in this blog post, because thats not really what its about. Ill tell you what I hope this post is about. Its about the frightening rollercoaster that the college application is. This process is merely more than just typing up words and hitting a submit button. Youre sending away, with each application, a little investment of emotions, and a little bit of life that washes into some machinery and potentially shapes the next four years. Yes, the applications are important, and yes, its alright to be invested. If this is about where you will spend a good chunk of your life, I daresay its necessary to be invested. But at the same time, youll need to distance yourself from the process a bit. Care about it but not to the extent that it intricately wraps itself around your self-worth.  For colleges as deeply selective as MIT, theres a lot out of your control, and regardless of what that letter you see on Pi Day says, it really wont matter in the long run. If its a yes, congratulations. Youve been given a great opportunity. MIT deeply believes in you. If its a no, thats fine. Its not a declaration of your worth; its not MIT saying that you dont belong; its not a testament to some kind of skewed outlook your future will take. A long time ago, I did all the wrong things. I worried about the little details and applied without a true sense of what I was applying for. I tried to put greater meaning into scores and stats than they really held. I was obsessed with getting in to the point that it somehow became the center of my daily thoughts. And when rejection did come, I was stunned and upset. I felt denied of some deserved right, when it was really more privilege than right. Genuinely care about the places you apply to, and if you do find that a certain college has no room for you at this point in time, then Ill tell you what my mom told me: you will be fine. Penns rejection tore me down, but if Id known then what I know now, not about where I would end up, but about how I can rise above a letter of rejection, Id have handled it a whole lot better. And I do want you to know. With tenacity of will, the future will shape itself to suit you and your inner strength. Life delights in throwing stumbling blocks. But where wounds may be inflicted, scars heal and strength grows.***Another thing I hope this post is about: time, people. The people that have been there with you from the get-go, the friends that you made in high school, the parents that have held you close and whispered assurances; theyve forged themselves into your life before now, and they will for a long, long time. Every step of the way that led to MIT, for every rejection and acceptance and moment of uncertainty, I had friends and family who wiped away my tears when tears came and held me high when joy arrived. Time with the people we love is a truly beautiful gift. Consider the extent of the things they have done and could do, will do, for you, and learn to appreciate them every day. Life is much bigger than what will happen soon, more unpredictable than whatever signs that hang in your mind try to suggest. For now, try not to fret. Keep doing the things you love. Keep writing. Keep playing trombones. Keep making slam-dunks. Keep singing. Keep watching your favorite TV shows. Keep laughing. And keep the people you love close to you. I took a gap year out of necessity. At the time, it felt like the worst thing that could happen. It felt too long and the question of where I would end up seemed very subject to chance. But I kept living. I kept pushing forward. And somehow, Im here right now, typing from a place that had once felt too large to be a dream. Whatever happens in the next couple of days, you will find that you do have the strength to keep living, that you will be where you need to be, and that you will thrive. Dont overanalyze the steps leading to that point. Some things you just cant predict. And even though it may not always feel like it, trust me. Youll be fine.*** Christina T., Me, Erica D., and Jen L. representing MIT in Florence! So I don't know if you could tell, but I was teaching in Italy over IAP. In October, I applied to MIT's Global Teaching Labs Program, and after an application and interview, was deemed among 30 or so students qualified to teach Italian high schoolers some science, in English. I'd like to present my experience as 10 lessons-- not the ones I taught, but the ones I learned. (  )*:           1. Don't worry about the uncontrollable. Here, I specifically mean flying. Due to the polar vortex commotion, my flight to Milan was one of the thousands cancelled and rescheduled for a full 2 days later. Arriving late to my job wasn't a problem because I made up the missing hours by teaching a few extra classes. On the way back, my flight was delayed again-- but don't blame the polar vortex, this time it was all me. In the JFK layover, I somehow fell asleep while sitting at the gate... for exactly the 40 minutes it took for my plane to arrive, board, depart, and probably get to Boston. Classic.           2. Do things you think you can't. When I signed up, I agreed to teach Biology and Chemistry. I love those subjects. I know them pretty well. But when I got assigned to my school, they wanted me to teach --gasp-- math and physics. Physics. We're talking the subject I never took in high school, and merely passed freshman fall. I cant... right? Ok, time to properly learn it! In the end, I loved and felt awesome teaching all my subjects, which turned out to be a whooping mix of: Electricity, Combinatorics and Probability, Acid-Base Chemistry, and Biology.            3. However little time there is, use it. For example, in learning a new language before traveling to that country. You know, it's mathematically proven that learning at 200 word vocabulary is 100 times better than just knowing "pizza" and "espresso." And from my experience, having 30 minutes to plan a lesson is infinitely better than none. And having a few hours is infinitely-infinitely better than that. But now we're getting into different types of infinities, which is it's own blog post.            4. Embrace culture. Basically, I never drank a single cup of American coffee while in Italy... and probably won't ever again. While embracing other cultures, don't forget to break stereotypes from our own! Because the majority of America is not uneducated, wasteful, and overweight. I think. I hope. My host family was continually surprised that I knew food such as linguine, fettuccine, and gnocchi. Though the dishes my host mom and grandma made were of course the best I ever had, being homemade and mouth-melting.            5. Don't be afraid to say "yes." I kept taking on more classes and experiences, and didn't regret a single moment. With my host family's older brother, I went to my first Qwan Ki Do lesson. Having never done any form of martial arts before, I was a tad intimidated to go. But alas, I am now wiser about how to handle a bamboo stick.           6. Don't be afraid to say "no." Teaching in Italy turned out to be way more intense than I ever anticipated. Having to prepare and deliver lessons 6 days a week was an immersive experience, but it was also taxing. Make sure you're not pushing your physical limits. I felt so energized and excited when I was around people, but a bit overwhelmed when planning for the next day at night, every night. I needed to recuperate for a few solid days when I came back to campus. But it was so worth it.           7. Some things are universal. Or quasi-universal. Like Latin. Really, I hadn't expected SAT skills to come up again in my life, but studying all those Latin roots definitely eased me into Italian. Also universal are facial expressions and hand gestures, which definitely overcompensated my language deficit. I can leave it unsaid that attitude and kindness can be sensed without words.           8. Open yourself to people. I stayed with the most wonderful host family while in Italy. It was truly incredible getting to know them, and their extended family, and all their family friends. Everyone I personally had met in Italy was so warm, so thoughtful, and so willing to feed me good Italian food. The language barrier won't be so bad if you radiate feelings (also I was really lucky that someone would always be able to speak English). Giant shout-out to Flavia, Nereo, Elia, Filippo, and Nonna for welcoming me into their lives!            9. Get out there! Because Italy is about 2 Floridas (a standard unit of measurement), and I come from a strong public transportation background, I loved using Italy's transportation system to get me to places I have never been to before. Example: Mountains. Wow.            10. Make an impact, however you can. GTL emphasizes Mens et Manus, MIT's motto. In this way, it was good that I couldn't entirely rely on English to get information across-- I used many visual, experiment-based, and exploratory methods.  I believe that *discovery* is an essential component of learning, while passion is an essential component of teaching.   All in all, I learned to teach and taught to learn! * *(^ o ^)/* *  Growing up, I admit that I watched a decent amount of television. I wasnt a couch potato by any means; I loved to go fishing with my neighbor, take walks in the shaded walkways behind my house, or build oddly shaped sculptures in the sandbox with my friends. The magic of television lay in its ability to transport me to another world, another story, and another life. So I indulged in the visual fantasies, especially when I came down with a case of the sniffles and the best place to curl up and nap was the sofa in front of the TV. A side effect of television was the exposure to the infamous world of infomercials. Early morning and late night viewings were fraught with empty promises and enticing offers for magical stain cleaning liquid, blankets (with sleeves!), and convenient kitchenware that would help you slap your troubles away. But after a while, even the low, low price of $19.95 wasnt enough to convince me that those products were worth buying. Id finally developed a healthy dose of marketing skepticism. While contemplating my collegiate future, I read my fair share of pamphlets, hand-outs, and websites, all expounding on their respective colleges advantages and benefits. I half expected the next pamphlet to offer me free shipping and handling if I called right away. Maybe I had a little bit more than a healthy dose of skepticism, but the point still remained that without experiencing the college firsthand, there was no way for me to know what they really meant by rigorous curriculum or unparalleled opportunities. As decision time approaches, many of you are probably facing the same dilemma. On MITs admissions website, we claim that MIT is one of the best places in the world to be a student and the top two reasons listed are the incredible faculty and the strong culture of student collaboration. Bold words. Id just like to put my two cents out there and let any prospective students know that sometimes, even catchy promotional phrases can ring true. Incredible Faculty: As you all probably know, MIT is known for having some famous faculty. Professor Eric Lander, perhaps best known for his contribution to the Human Genome Project, teaches 7.012 Introductory Biology (which I took last semester) along with Professor Robert Weinberg who discovered the first human oncogene Ras. Of course, many universities have their own famous and accomplished faculty members. But from personal experience, I can attest to the fact that the faculty members here really seem to care about the students and they are willing to do more than just stand in front of the lecture hall and teach. Last semester, a group of six students and I took Professor Weinberg out to dinner via the UA Student-Faculty Dinner program. He didnt treat the invitation as an obligation, but rather seemed genuinely happy to spend a night talking to his students. We spent hours at the restaurant, talking and laughing about research, MIT, and life in general. One digression led to a conversation on the nature of lactose intolerance and the extent to which each of us enjoyed dairy products (I, for one, am a great proponent of cheese consumption). This semester, ClubChem hosted a faculty dinner with Professor Danheiser, the professor for my 5.12 Organic Chemistry course. While devouring plates of deliciously free Thai food, we all sat in a circle of desks as the professor recounted his own life story and answered any student questions. His experiences as an undergraduate researcher were hilariously relatable and he wasnt afraid to laugh along with us. The professors here are people too and they want to get to know the students they are teaching. Needless to say, in the classroom, they do their job well. My 18.03 Differential Equations professor always shows up to class with a huge smile on his face and a bounce to his step, eager to begin the lesson. Unfortunately, I make the mistake, sometimes, of leaving my 18.02 Multivariable Calculus pset until the night before its due. WE INTERRUPT THIS BLOG POST WITH AN IMPORTANT PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT: ** Do not, I repeat, do not leave your psets until the night before they are due. Bad things will happen. Horses will start eating each other and Voldemort might return. Also you might not get any sleep, which is probably even worse than those other things. Ok. Thank you. That is all. ** On this particular Wednesday evening, I was sitting by myself, slogging through mathematical proofs by the dim glow of my desk lamp. A glance towards my warm bed only solidified the regret I had of starting so late. I was all by my lonesome self now. The problems on our psets are designed to test problem solving skills, not just a students ability to regurgitate the formulas and equations. Working with others allows us to bounce ideas around and compare methods. In the real world, you arent alone; there are usually people around you who can help. The homework at MIT taps into this mindset and the professors encourage us to work together as we will when we leave the shelter of a college campus and enter into another phase of our lives. Of course, there are people who breeze through the psets on their own with no problem. But for the most part, as you stroll through the student center, or the basement of Maseeh, you will see clusters of students at every other table and chair, working together to finish a pset or a project. Student collaboration isnt just a suggestion, its the norm and its something I appreciate about MITs culture. But wait, theres more!: To be completely honest (and thats all Im trying to be here, for the benefit of my fellow skeptics out there), I cant say whether or not MIT is unique in its incredible faculty or culture of student collaboration. Never having experienced other colleges firsthand, theres no way for me to know whether or not they too live up to their brochure and pamphlet standards. But no one is making me write this. I just wanted to share my own perspective. Thats the best we can really do: provide our own snapshot of MIT. Its like a collage. No one photo can truly encompass everything that MIT is and represents, but each opinion adds something to the conversation. So if you have any questions, Id love to answer them! And if you email right now, Ill throw in a free doodle! Yes, thats right, Ill answer your question, and send you a free doodle of whatever you want!* *Terms and conditions may apply.  Congratulations to the incoming Class of 2018!  Each and every one of you is incredible, and I am so excited to see your happy faces light up the institute once again in the fall!   So now you've decided to go to MIT, but you haven't paid a dime or picked a class yet. The biggest thing on your plate right now is figuring out when to take the Freshman Essay Evaluation (FEE) or which pre-orientation program to take. Meanwhile, all your other friends are picking out their schedule for the fall. Some of them already know where they are living, and maybe they even entered a randomized lottery to get placed in their basic required classes that everyone else is getting placed in.  MIT is different from other schools. I want to lay out some basics about what you might want or need to know about your freshmen year.  I've learned a lot through my own experiences from my first year at MIT, as well as through being an associate advisor my sophomore year.  Here is my advice! And also some descriptions of what will be required of you as a frosh. Do a Freshman Pre-Orientation Program (FPOP) The applications are due June 15th! SIGN UP FOR AN FPOP!! There is an awesome Mark Twain quote on the FPOP website: "Twenty Years from now you will be more disappointed by the things you didn't do than by the ones you did. So throw off the bowlines. Sail away from the safe harbor. Catch the trade winds in your sails. Explore. Dream."                                       - Mark Twain (1835-1910) I think Mark Twain and MIT admissions painted the right picture for you - FPOPs are a great opportunity for you to do things outside of your comfort zone, and it also is the perfect way for you to start making friends that will last you your four years at MIT and beyond.  The FPOPs range from aerospace to computer science to energy to leadership to exercise to literature to product design and SO MUCH MORE! This year there are twenty-two FPOPs offered in August, and each one gives an amazing introduction to MIT and the beautiful city that surrounds us. My experience includes doing the Freshman Urban Planning FPOP as a frosh, and working as a mentor for the Discover Materials Science & Engineering FPOP.  Each one introduced me to MIT, Cambridge, Boston, and a new group of awesome friends, and I am so grateful for the opportunities! Preservation of the Frosh  Just a few logistics - you are a prefrosh right now, and the 2017s are frosh.  You will not be a frosh and the frosh will not be sophomores until President Reif goes on a giant stage and welcomes you, the Class of 2018, as the freshman class.  President Hockfield never welcomed the Class of 2015 because of bad weather. They are still freshman. This makes sense. The reason why this is how it is and the way it has always be done is because we want to have prefrosh for as long as possible, and there must always be a freshman class, and while sophomores become juniors and juniors become seniors and seniors become crufty, sophomores don't need to be conserved. Only you, the prefrosh or frosh of MIT, must be conserved. Take HASS Classes! Now into some academics - I'll briefly explain the HASS system here at MIT. You are required to take eight HASS - humanities, arts, and social sciences - classes during your time here at MIT.  Of those eight classes, you must take at least one humanities, one arts, and one social sciences class. You must also fulfill a HASS concentration, which involves taking 3-4 classes in a certain subject. For example, I plan on concentrating in writing poetry, which involves me taking a few poetry workshop classes and a reading poetry class. TAKE A HASS CLASS YOUR FIRST SEMESTER! Take at least one HASS class EACH semester!!  I have made this mistake twice and I cannot emphasize it enough.  Taking four (or five) technical classes is extremely difficult, and might drive you insane.  I understand that you might want to take all your required GIRs first semester since you are on Pass/No Record and don't want to have to worry about getting a good grade in these really difficult classes.  But this leads me to my next point... Pass/No Record is NOT an excuse to get a C- in every class You will hear "A=B=C=P," and it might be true when it comes down to a transcript, but it is not true when it comes to challenging yourself and figuring out what it takes to get an A in a class at MIT.  Aim high and try the hardest you can in your classes - the semester will be over more quickly than you know, and you will have to take graded classes based on the information you learned in your Pass/No Record classes.  If you didn't learn any information, then you really are going to be sad in the following semesters.  Use Pass/No Record to your advantage by seeing how much you can handle on your plate in addition to your classes.  Join a club sport or class council or rush a fraternity (and steal all their food and then come to East Campus)  and use this time to become close with the people around you.  Watch how you can allocate your time to still do well in your classes while being involved on campus, and make sure that you are not overcommitting to too much.  Pass/No Record is not an excuse to not try in your classes, but it is an excuse to go outside your comfort zone to figure out what it takes to live a balanced life at MIT.  People say "Social Life, Classes, Sleep - pick two." But you can have all three, even at a place with incredibly difficult and time-consuming classes like MIT. Classes to take your Freshman Year So you have to take a HASS class and you have to do your best in your classes - but what should those classes be?  I'm going to highlight the technical class options you have for your freshman year. All MIT students must complete a total of 17 General Institute Requirements, or GIRs.  It is possible to get out of some of these GIRs through AP credit or through passing an Advanced Standing Exam (ASE), which is basically like taking the final of the class right at the bat of the semester.  At any other time, the grade you get on an ASE would show up on your transcript. As a freshman on Pass/No Record, if you pass the ASE, you get a P! They have extended the offered biology classes from my year to include four different types of introductory classes that fulfill the biology requirement: 7.012, 7.013, 7014, and 7.016.  In the fall, you can take either 7.012 or 7.016. 7.013 and 7.014 are offered in the spring.  All of these classes cover the same fundamental principles of biochemistry, genetics, molecular and cell biology.  However, they each focus on a different one of these.   I recommend taking biology in the fall if you feel confident in your chemistry abilities, and in the spring if you do not.  I took biology at the same time as my chemistry class, and it did feel quite overwhelming at times.  Definitely try to split them apart so you can focus on them individually. Here at MIT, you are required to take single-variable (18.01) and multi-variable (18.02) calculus.  There are different versions of each that you can take, and my advice is to take the slightly harder version of whatever you feel comfortable with, that way you can drop down to a different version of the class if you decide that it is too difficult.  I would also recommend doing whichever track allows you to take 18.03, or differential equations, in the spring, although this might not be feasible for people who want to take 18.014 and 18.024, which are advanced classes that focus on calculus with theory.  18.03 is not a GIR (contrary to popular belief), but many, if not most, majors have it as a requirement.  It also is an extremely difficult and important class, and it is very necessary to have a strong math background before taking it. So if you ASE or AP out of 18.01, congratulations! Take 18.02 or 18.014. If you do not ASE or AP out of 18.01, taking 18.01 is fine, but consider taking 18.01A/18.02A.  This class involves a six-week review of single-variable claculus, and then 18.02 taken at the regular pace, which continues into IAP (Independent Activities Period during January).  Besides, if you start out taking 18.01A, it is perfectly fine and acceptable to drop down to 18.01 if it ends up being too difficult. Challenge yourself! Freshman year is all about discovering what your limits are - if 18.01A extends beyond your limits, that is okay! It does not mean you are any less smart than any of your peers or that you don't belong at MIT, it just means that maybe you weren't quite ready for that class. I am biased because I am course 3 (materials science and engineering), but TAKE 3.091!! Okay now I am going to be honest - you will have the option to take one of the following: 5.111, 5.112, or 3.091.  5.111 (pronounced five-eleven-one) is basic chemistry, with slightly more focus on liquid-state materials.  5.112 (pronounced five-eleven-two) is a bit more advanced version of 5.111, and covers additional materials that might help you if you plan on majoring in chemistry or becoming pre-med.  3.091 (pronounced three-oh-nine-one) focuses on solid-state materials, which I think are extremely interesting and I thought that the class was very well taught.  You might have heard rumors about 3.091 in the fall having no tests and, as a result, being quite disorganized and/or terrible.  However, this fall, 3.091 is going to be taught in the traditional way with tests (and hopefully no attendance grade) and small quizzes and the really great Professor Cima, and it will be an awesome class! Take it! Learn about phase diagrams and chocolate and materials! Yay materials! Yay polymers! The other day, I got a facebook message from the lovely Kimia Z. '18 asking about first semester physics, which is mechanics. She told me that her school has a very weak physics program, and she wanted to know if I would recommend she try to take classes over the summer. I told her that if you don't feel confident in your physics skills, I highly recommend taking 8.01L in the fall.  The class has the same content as 8.01, but it is taught over a longer period of time and in lecture style instead of in TEAL sessions, where you learn about a concept and immediately do a problem about it on whiteboards around the room in groups.  8.01L consists of the fall semester and IAP, and it was completely worth taking 8.01L for me and I felt a lot more confident about my physics skills moving at the slower pace than I would have in 8.01 TEAL. If you do feel uncomfortable with your physics background and want to take 8.01 anyway, that is perfectly fine, and again, you can always switch it to 8.01L later. And if you want to review concepts before classes start, MIT opencourseware is an amazing resource! The other requirement is 8.02, which is about electrical and magnetic properties in physics.  This is also taught in TEAL style, however, if you feel super confident in your physics abilities, you can choose to take 8.012 and 8.022 in the fall and spring respectively, which are advanced versions of each of the classes, taught in lecture style. Many of my friends on Tetazoo did this track, and they really enjoyed the classes and are now planning on double majoring in physics! Will L. '16 described the difference - "8.012 and 8.022 are good for showing what course 8 is like at MIT. 8.01 and 8.02 are more engineering classes." I mentioned the HASS requirement earlier, but in addition to taking 8 HASS classes, two of those classes must be communication intensive classes. Depending on if you get out of taking the FEE or if you pass it, you will either have to take a CI-H (communication intensive humanities class) or a CI-HW (communication intensive humanities writing class) your freshman year.  These classes involve writing a couple essays, writing a revision for one of those essays, and writing a big paper at the end. I don't like papers.  I took Bioethics (24.06) my freshman spring and it was okay. I'm doing anything I can to procrastinate taking another CI-H. Don't procrastinate!! The HASS classes are all listed on the internet with the other classes. That's all great... but when do I actually pick out my classes? In the fall! When you get here for your pre-orientation program, you are going to check into your temporary room in your temporary dorm, and you are going to spend many hours of many days at your FPOP having fun. After the final day of your FPOP, you will check in with your orientation leader.  (Quick note - Orientation activities are optional.)  This is the week that you will meet with your advisor and your associate advisor(s), and they will help you sort out your final schedule. It is nice to have some sort of plan on what you want to take, but that is not at all necessary.  You will very likely get the classes you want to take.  This leads me to my next point... Meet your Advising Team! Free food! Woo advising teams! I was an associate advisor this past year, and it was my duty, along with a faculty advisor, to help my advisees choose a path that was right for them. My advice to you is to keep in touch with your advising team - we are a great resource for you to reach out to in case of trouble with choosing classes or doing well in classes or life or anything else at all!  Come ask us questions! We will send you care packages and take you to get ice cream and more! As far as choosing freshman advising, there are two main options. You can choose advising that involves credit such as a learning community, or advising that offers no credit like traditional advising.  There is also residence based advising in some dorms, but, in my personal opinion, this system is a little unfair because it requires you to be stuck in your dorm for a full year, even if you decide that it is not the place for you.  Please keep this in mind when choosing which dorm you want to live in, because this can be a big commitment.  The dorms that have RBA are Maseeh, McCormick, Next House, Chocolate City, and Spanish House.  So if you know that these are the places that you want to live in forever and ever, go ahead! Put them as your first choice! But, be forewarned, if it turns out that the place isn't all you thought it was, you are stuck! (These are my opinions - there are many people who end up loving their dorm and the residence based advising programs!) I am a big fan of traditional advising, which just makes it so that your advisor is there for you when you need them, if you need them, and same with your associate advisor.  But all in all, your biggest source of information will be the upperclassmen on campus that you live with, work with, eat with, and are friends with. So come talk to us, we don't bite! And feel free to ask me questions anytime - comment below or come visit me during rush in East Campus! I'll dye your head a strange color! Or all the colors! Take Physical Education Classes EARLY. TAKE THE SWIM TEST! You just got here. It's day one of orientation, and you're signed up for the 12pm swim test.  But you're sleepy. You rather sleep. Sleep sleep sleep. GET UP! Go take the swim test! There are some people who wait until right before they graduate to take the swim test - don't do that! If you fail, you don't get to graduate from MIT. You have to wait another semester. Don't do that!!  If you don't feel comfortable swimming, that is okay! Take the swim physical education class right away! Don't save these required things for your senior year, because you only need to miss a few PE classes to fail one. Also, people will tell you that you need to complete the physical education requirement by your sophomore year. This is not true. Sometimes, you just cannot fit a PE class into your schedule - that is completely understandable. But try to spread out taking the classes, or at least a couple of the four required PE classes, during your freshman year while you have the time to do so.  And take the swim test! Do it!! Take advantage of REX! IT IS CPW ALL OVER AGAIN - BUT EVEN BETTER! Orientation - AKA Rush - is another time when we, the denizens of East Campus, as well as all other living groups around campus do everything in our/their power to convince you that our/their dorm is the best dorm and that you should live here/there!  I will post a lot of pictures in the fall of the awesome activities (including roller coaster building!) happening around East Campus, but do your best to visit every single dorm on campus, steal all the free food, and have a great time! Make new friends, build awesome things, eat great food, and have the time of your life before classes start and consume us all. I hope my little tidbits of advice are helpful!

In a nutshell or two: I'm a budding MechE, love building things, and like to pretend I can do a British accent.

And, of course, a... read more  see complete archives   Below is one of the robots I built for 2.007, MIT's extremely popular introductory design and manufacturing class:    For reference, here's the first "robot" I ever built, on the first day of 2.007:  Before I took 2.007, I hadn't ever used a mill or lathe.  I wasn't sure what it meant to tap a hole. Heck, I'd never used a power drill before.  But four months later, I was comfortable with all of these tools, thanks in large part to the awesome shop guys (particularly Bill and Tasker). I built my first gearbox and learned how to use fast fabrication methods.  And I built a pair of robots that actually did quite well in the competition!  It's been a lot of fun.  Here's a rough summary of the past few months: 2.007 is well known for its chaos and intensity, and it's intimidating to be told that by the end of this class you'll be building a Robot, capital 'R', and competing against your peers, many of whom have had years of FIRST robotics experience.  Suddenly you're faced with design decisions, big scary machine tools that you're not entirely comfortable turning on, part choices, and Arduinos, maybe even before you know what gears and bearings and linkages are. So what do you do?  Like any good engineer, break it up into smaller, more manageable pieces.  Our first assignment is to build a "Mini Me" robot that can drive around from a basic list of materials.  By the end of lab, I've bandsawed the glorified bent piece of plastic above and stuck 2 motors + an RC receiver on it.  It's not pretty, but it drives. At the end of lab, my (awesome) lab instructor Chip reminds us to always fasten our wheels, because loose wheels have tripped up many a top competitor before.  ~~~foreshadowing alert~~~ This year's robot competition is ski-themed - MITSKI! The instructors have build this cool course consisting of three different hills of different grades, with flags to pull, medals to collect, and trophies to pull.  Quickly it becomes apparent that the most efficient way to score points is to do laps on the extremely steep 60 degree top hill (in hindsight, I wish they had made flag pulling worth more points, as it would have led to more interesting robot mechanisms).  It's not a trivial problem to solve.  Because of the steepness of the hill, tipping is a problem.  Because of the slippery surface material, slipping is also a problem. As Richard Hammond from Top Gear tells us in a recorded video, "keep your centers of gravity low and your coefficients of friction high." For several days I iterate and iterate on a design (nicknamed "Spatula Bot") that tries to climb the steep hill by keeping my center of gravity extremely low.  It works, kind of; it's extremely slow up the slope, far too slow to have any hope of running multiple laps during the 120 second competition period.  Notice that I'm making extensive use of waterjetting sheet metal to make precise, elegant parts; thanks to my friend Emma S. '16 for her help waterjetting!  Amusingly, one of the robots on the final day is named "Flagrant Abuse of the Waterjet", a title that would have been accurate for my robots. Major credit goes to Josh B. '16, as he designs the first robot capable of quickly climbing the top hill, using a rail gripper.  His design ends up strongly influencing the rest of the field's hill climbers as well.  Here's a CAD of one of my early successful prototypes utilizing a "ski gripper", v2 of what eventually becomes my Ascensionist robot:  The RC controllers and Playstation controllers provided by 2.007 aren't terribly reliable or easy to use.  I decide early on to use my iPhone and iPad to control my robots via OSC, a wireless protocol usually used by DJs to connect to sound synthesizers.  This has the advantage of letting me avoid the bottleneck of waiting for available RC controllers later in the semester.  I briefly toy around with the idea of making a robot with large diameter wheels that drives equally well upside down, and build a few prototypes.  But the high speed motors I'm using don't have enough torque to drive the large wheels up the top hill, and I decide to revert to a strategy of building roll bars:  And this ends up being very similar to my final design; I also lower my entire chassis and use a 3D printed fixture to mount my motors.  Early on I discovered that tumbling down the top hill easily damages the delicate high speed motors I'm using.  My 3D printed mounts work well, and soon after lots of people are using them for their robots as well. As you can see from the propagation of Josh's rail gripper idea and my 3D printed motor mounts, ideas spread fast in 2.007.  That's the way it's designed: even though you're building your robot as an individual, especially for beginner builders it's essential to collaborate and work with other people.  Forget about "helping the competition"; working together and seeing what designs work (and just as important, which designs don't work) will save loads of time and lead to better robots for everyone. Plus, these are your peers, who you'll be working together with in 2.008, 2.009, and other team projects.  Don't burn your bridges by being petty and accusing people of "stealing" your general ideas.  This ain't Apple vs. Samsung. I've got my hill climbing robot mostly done, but I also want to build a robot that pulls down the multiplier.  But there's no way I'll be able to design, fabricate, and test an additional robot in 1 week.  Is there? One of the most underutilized resources in 2.007 (in my opinion) is a document called "How To Build Your Everything Really Really Fast".  It's written by Charles Guan, who now teaches the electric gokart special section of 2.007 (see, "it doesn't have to be a robot"), and goes into lots of fast fabrication techniques. Robust robot designs generally require a lot of right angles; with traditional fabrication techniques this can involve lots of milling and drilling precise holes.  But using waterjetting and fastener techniques like "t-nuts", you can save a lot of time and throw together fairly complicated robots quickly. A task that would have seemed impossible for me at the beginning of the semester, but thanks to Tasker and Steve (the shop guys in charge of the waterjet and lasercutter) I'm able to do it.  Here's the gearbox that eventually goes into the robot at the top of this page:  Note the extensive use of standoffs and t-nuts.  This makes my multiplier bot extremely modular; I'm able to completely disassemble and iterate my chassis and gearbox design in minutes, as opposed to hours.  Here's the final design of my 2 robots:  My hill climber robot scores enough points to seed me 2nd in the tournament (behind the aforementioned Josh), which means that I have a guaranteed spot on the final day of competition, and get to relax and watch the preliminaries. Then competition day comes, and it's totally awesome.  Besides the robots, there's this "Engineering Petting Zoo" showcasing cool machines from companies and students.  Among the stuff featured: Tony Stewart's NASCAR racecar, a Corvette, and electric gokarts built by the 2.007 alternate section. But the robots are the main attraction of the day, of course.  I'm able to cruise through the first few rounds of competition despite my hill climber flipping over, thanks to my multiplier bot.  Clockwise from top left: me controlling my hill climber via iPhone, Josh's hill climber + medal grabber bot, Danny (one of the lab instructors) and his Ski Patrol outfit, my multiplier bot in action.  Photo credits to Landon C. '17. But robustness is key, and one of my hill climber's wheels pops off in the final 8 round. I knew I should have listened to Chip and remembered to screw those wheels on.  An unfortunate time to learn that lesson, but I still have a lot of fun watching the final 4 duke it out. The final match, between Josh B. '16 and Clare Z. '16 proves to be especially exciting.  Josh's pair of autonomous robots has performed well all night and is capable of scoring well over 600 points - but Clare's manually controlled robot is crucially super robust and reliable.  In a huge upset, Josh's hill climber gets stuck in a rut, meaning his multiplier bot isn't able to push the trophy, and Clare wins with a score of 312.   Clare winning the gold trophy, next to Professor Sangbae Kim and Professor Amos Winter.  Photo credit to Landon C. '17. A thrilling end to the night, and a great way to cap off my favorite class at MIT so far.  I can't wait to take 2.008 and 2.009! Week 1: Spider-Man, Nina Yuen, and More! The concept is simple, users ask the question "What if x piece of history was different" and the more historically inclined Redditors construct an argument, with sources, about what would have happened. Here are a few of my favorite questions. "How would modern American football players fare in an ancient world?" "What if Afghanistan was never invaded by the United Front and the Taliban regime continued to conquer all of Afghanistan?" "What would allow the Roman Empire to last until today?"  A few months back I discovered the Geek And Sundry Youtube series of TableTop and I fell in love. Every week Wil Wheaton would gather a few of his celebrity friends and play a new Board/Card/Role-Playing game. The show was funny, the games were interesting, and it helped kindle a deep love of TableTop gaming. I burnt through all of the episodes in about a week or two and word on the street was that they were going to try to Crowdfund season 3. After a few weeks of doing just that, they've exceeded their goals and will be able to make 20 episodes and a Role-Playing Game show. I can't wait!   Net Neutrality is a topic that I've been closely following for a while now. The decision that the FCC makes will have a large impact on my future career and it's nice to see Youtubers spreading the word.  A few weeks back I started taking Complexity Theory and it has quickly risen through the ranks of my favorite classes this year. Every lecture has been better than the one before and the world of P vs. NP is slowly making sense. Apologies for breaking the Zaxxon rule with this one but it's been a while since a series of lectures was this interesting. Click HERE for a nice ELI10 of the problem.  After reading through The Name of the Wind/A Wise Man's Fear during Christmas break I started looking around for more fantasy books to fill my time and picked up The Blade Itself (Book 1 of The First Law trilogy). Whereas most of the books I loved before coming to MIT were Young Adult I decided to move to the more mature end of the spectrum. I've been reading The Blade Itself sporadically since December but it was becoming increasingly difficult to remember names or what's going on. So lately I've been waking up a little bit early to read every morning and I absolutely love the book.    And with that I'll finish asking you guys a simple question, what's making you happy this week? Trouble thinking up a good Kerberos username? Take some hints from Batman.                           Earlier this week, Morgan O. (G) invited MIT EMS and our campus police officers (who unfortunately could not attend) to see the place where she works - the roof of the Green Building!  The Green Building is the tallest building in Cambridge - 19 stories tall and on stilts at 277 feet!  She brought up her giant telescope and we looked at the moon, Mars, Jupiter and more! The view from the Green Building, the home of MIT's Earth and Planetary Scienes department, was absolutely gorgeous!  Lawrence W. (G) brought his really pretty camera and I brought mine, and we had some fun with them on the roof!   Adam S. '14 wanted a photo of him in front of the fanastic Boston skyline, and it wasn't long before everyone wanted their shot in front of the view!          In the end, we had a wonderful time, and we were all so glad that Morgan brought us up there to see Boston and Cambridge from a completely new perspective.  see complete archives  Today we're releasing our decisions regarding transfer applicants who applied for admission for Fall 2014. Transfer applicants, unlike freshman applicants, receive decisions via email from our office to the address listed on their application. The emails will be sent at 5 PM Eastern today, May 7, and you should receive it shortly thereafter, depending on the traffic in the tubes. Our transfer admissions process was quite competitive. As in past years, hundreds of students applied, and we only had space to admit fewer than 20 students. It is a difficult process: as usual, we are very excited about the students we have admitted, and often chagrined about those we could not. As a former transfer student myself, I know that this process can be a complicated one. For those of you who were admitted: welcome to MIT. For those who weren't: I wish you the best of luck. I transferred, but if I hadn't things would have been fine. Remember, college is mostly what you make of it, here or anywhere else; if you weren't one of those students whom we admitted, I wish you the best of luck wherever you go (or stay).  You: Where are you from?Me: London.You: But you...you don't...you don't seem to have a British accent.Me: Correct. Let me explain! I was born in Singapore, had a Singaporean accent, then moved to London during the summer before fifth... read more  see complete archives  Part 1 here. *     *     * Rush Holt is in the room, but most people havent noticed. To be fair, hes a name rather than a face for most of us: the PhD physicist-turned-politician, one of two physicists in Congress, now the US Representative for New Jerseys 12th congressional district. I happen to know what he looks like because an assistant addressed him by name when I passed by in the hallway.  Now, Im in a big room scarfing down bacon and coffee with over a hundred other representatives from science and engineering organizations, waiting for Rep. Holt to give a speech. And now that the Congressman is physically in the room, the internal conflict begins. I think, I will probably never have the chance to meet Rush Holt ever again. Then I think, I have nothing to say to Rush Holt, and he probably doesnt have anything to say to me since Im not one of his constituents, and the last time I was in New Jersey I was repulsed by the smell of industrial fumes along the New Jersey Turnpike. Finally, I gather my wits and conclude, Who cares? So, I walk over to where Rush Holt is standing. Well, actually, I walk up to Rep Holts staffer (Sean) and thank him for giving such a helpful presentation at the AAAS yesterday. While Sean and I are talking, Congressman Holt walks up to me. Rush Holt: Hi, Im Rush Holt.Um, no kidding. Me: Im Anna Ho. Im an undergraduate at MIT majoring in physics.Rush Holt: Physics!Me: Yes, I gather that we have something in common!Oh, dear. Someone sound the socially awkward alarm.Rush Holt: Who do you work with at MIT?Is Rush Holt intimately familiar with MITs physics department...? I give him a few names. He asks where Im from and what my research is about. We talk about pulsars, and at some point Rush Holt says "yes, I know what pulsars are. I'm a physicist!" At this point, a number of people are trying to get Rep. Holts attention, to tell him that its speech time. I excuse myself and go sit with the rest of the American Astronomical Society delegation, as the Congressman heads to the podium.  I miss his first few sentences, because I'm busy wondering how many people can say that they've talked to a Congressman about pulsars. *     *     * The United States House of Representatives occupies three office buildings along Independence Avenue. Breakfast with Rush Holt took place in one of them. We arrived there at 7:30am and waited in a long line to walk through metal detectors. The nice view of the Capitol Building nearly made up for the fact that it was FREEZING outside (Dear Washington DC: that was a pitiful excuse for Spring.)  Ive been on Capitol Hill for two days. Two days were enough to learn that things here unfold on VERY SHORT TIMESCALES. Yesterday, for example, we learned about a proposal to raise the FY 2015 NSF (National Science Foundation) budget from $7.25 billion to $7.5 billion. We were encouraged to urge our representatives to sign onto this letter. In order to urge intelligently, we had to memorize the following: its a Dear Colleague letter addressed to Chairman Frank Wolf and ranking member Chaka Fattah of the House CJS Appropriations Subcommittee, Congressman Butterfields office is leading the letter, the staff contact is Dennis Sills, and the deadline for signing is 1pm March 27. We are meeting with our representatives today, and March 27 is tomorrow. My team is comprised of myself, a graduate student from Georgia Tech, and an astronomer from the Harvard-Smithsonian Institute for Astrophysics. This is our schedule for the day: 9:00 AM Representative Katherine Clark (Massachusetts)10:00 AM Representative John Lewis (Georgia)10:30 AM Representative Michael Capuano (Massachusetts)- lunch, presumably -1:00 PM Senator Elizabeth Warren (Massachusetts)1:30 PM Senator Saxby Chambliss (Georgia)2:00 PM Senator Ed Markey (Massachusetts)2:30 PM Senator Johnny Isakson (Georgia) Im in charge of the meetings with Representative Capuano and Senator Markey. I secured our appointments through a combination of e-mail exchanges and embarrassing phone conversations. Now, its 8:30am and time to find Rep Clarks office. I hyperventilate a little bit and skim my notes from yesterday. My name is Anna Ho, and Im a constituent living in Cambridge. Im a senior at MIT majoring in physics, but today Im here representing the American Astronomical Society. In the fall, Im going to start a PhD program in astronomy  but when I started college, I didnt think that I was cut out to be a research scientist. The summer after my sophomore year, I did an internship funded by the National Science Foundation. I loved it so much that I went back the next summer and did it again. I learned that I wanted to do research because I had the opportunity to try doing research. And I had that opportunity because of this program. I became a scientist because of this program, and I would be very happy to tell you more about it.  *     *     * You can learn a lot about a politician by looking around his office. For example, Representative John Lewis was one of the leaders of the African-American Civil Rights Movement, and you could probably piece this together from the shelves full of awards and medals. A Martin Luther King Jr. Dr. sign hangs over one of the big wooden doors, with the following quote: Public officers are the trustees and servants of the people who are at all times amenable to them. There are Coca Cola bottles everywhere. We had a similar experience in Senator Chamblisss office later in the afternoon; apparently this is a Georgia Thing. Another Georgia Thing is peanuts. Peanut bowls in both offices prompted my Georgia Tech teammate to exclaim Georgia peanuts! Similarly, stepping into Representative Capuanos office feels  at least, to this Massachusetts resident  bizarrely like stepping into a museum of home. The first thing I notice is an MIT flag on the wall, dangling with flags from all of District 7s many universities and colleges. The tables are covered with editions of the New England Journal of Medicine and local newspapers. On the wall is a picture of Jordan Hall, where I once went to watch Davie 12 sing Mendelssohns oratorio Elijah, as well as a plaque about Reach Out, an organization I volunteered with as an MIT freshman. Senator Markeys office is less home-y, so while waiting for our meeting to start I sit on the long dark red couch and stare at framed pictures: over the fireplace, Markey with Obama and Markey with Ted Kennedy, on a table to my right, Markey with Obama and Nancy Pelosi, and by the door, an aerial picture of Boston and the Charles, MIT just out of sight. *     *     * We meet with Representatives in the morning, eat lunch, then meet with Senators in the afternoon. We stand up when the staffer enters, shake hands, introduce ourselves, sit around a table. When its my turn to lead the meeting, I tell the staffer about NSF-funded research internships for undergraduates (REUs), and how having the opportunity to do science research over the summer is what made me decide to go into science research as a career. Nicole (from Georgia Tech) chimes in to say that she did an REU as an undergraduate as well, and that its also what inspired her to continue in science. Kelly (from Harvard-Smithsonian) then explains that she did an REU as an undergraduate and now runs a Solar Physics REU. I emphasize that NSF funding is crucial not just for building telescope facilities and paying researchers, but also for maintaining these important educational programs. Rep. Capuanos staffer is very interested; he pulls out a notebook, writes down the name of the program, takes notes on what were saying. He tells us that Capuanos office is totally on board with all this science funding stuff, that theyve already signed onto the NSF Dear Colleague letter, that having anecdotes like this from us is very helpful as they try to convince others to do the same. In between meetings and on the way to lunch, we walk through underground tunnels and keep an eye out for Congressmen, who are identifiable by the pins they wear. We run into Michele Bachmann while waiting for an elevator and catch a glimpse of Ted Cruz. We split up after lunch and I head over alone to the Senate building. Theres a long line inside the Senate Cafe; I sit at a table holding Paradise Lost, watching white shirts and pastel-colored ties flash by. The cafe is full of handshakes and sandwiches are tossed into paper boxes. No one seems to have time to sit and eat. And now, the Senate meetings. Turns out that Elizabeth Warren is holding a meet-and-greet:  That afternoon, there is only one moment that (initially) feels like a disaster. We're sitting with Sen. Markeys staffer, Dan, and I'm running the meeting. Dan has a PhD in physics and worked at the LHC for a while, and makes it clear from the start that his office is already on board. My brain says you have an action item! and my mouth starts moving on autopilot: My Mouth: Has Sen. Markey signed onto the Dear Colleague letter circulating in the House?Dan: ...Well, thats in the House, and were the Senate.My Brain: NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO WHY ANNA WHY Thinking quickly,Me: Well, is there an equivalent letter in the Senate?Dan: No, but I would be happy to start one. Wait, what? Dan: Its really helpful when scientists come in and give concrete suggestions for legislation they want to see. Wait, you want us to do that? Does anybody realize this? Does anybody understand the system well enough to even know what to ask for? Dan asks us to e-mail him the House letter. Still in shock, I offer my contact information as usual. Dan says that he will actually be in Cambridge in a few weeks, and would be happy to take me up on the offer of an MIT tour. A week later, Josh Shiode e-mails the AAS delegation saying Thanks to one of our teams, Senator Markeys office is leading a Dear Colleague letter in the Senate that closely mirrors the one in the House in support of $7.5 billion for NSF in FY 2015. Please send the below text and attached pdf to each of your Senate contacts and urge them to sign on to support this effort. A couple of days later, Dan e-mails me to say that the letter is circulating and 11 senators have signed on so far. Thought youd like to know! A week after that, I meet Dan in MIT's Lobby 7. Hansol '15 gives us a tour of Prof. Brad Pentelute's chemistry lab and two graduate students show us around the Man-Vehicle Lab. Between labs (getting around MIT involves a lot of walking) Dan and I discuss how to get scientists more involved in advocacy, and what a scientist's role in advocacy is in the first place. Eventually, Dan has to go get work done so I drop him off at the Stata Center. We shake hands, and I say that I'll be in touch. I mean it.  The first speech I ever gave in my life was to the 1000 of you who attended the CPW Welcome event Thursday night. It was a 5 minute, 5 step guide on "How to Do CPW", and I heard it was "amusing" though I was really going for inspirational and life-changing. Here's a gif in case you missed it:  At the time, I actually didnt know that there was a major difference since my CPW: THE EVENTS DIDNT GO PAST 2 AM. At least not officially. Come on MIT, what is that? Its breaking tradition to not have events registered around the clock. It made enough people upset that prefrosh might potentially get too much sleep, that I think its reverting back to a 24/7 schedule next year.   During CPW, there were little stations installed where you could fold cranes from white paper. I noticed them filling up over the weekend, though I didnt take a closer look. The end result? A HACK!! It was raised from the ceiling of Stata the night before the one-year memorial of Officer Sean Collier. It was such a stunning and poignant tribute that some people didn't realize it was a hack. I really commend those who put it together.  Then came Ring Delivery, which was the day after I went to an Iggy Azalea concert. Honestly, freshman year, I wasn't particularly interested in the brass rat. I thought "I don't like wearing jewelry, and anyway, it's expensive." Ive changed my mind since then, and think it is a genuinely special object due to its symbolism. As for the finances, I heard RingComm had funds left over that they were turning into subsidies for students. This was already demonstrated at Ring Premiere, because the first person in line won a free ring (hint for future years!). So as the rumor went, you had to get in line early for ring sales to get a subsidy. Therefore, Cara L. and I woke up at 6:30 am on a Saturday to get in line for 10 am sales: we were the 6th and 7th people in line! Turns out we didnt need to be so early because the first 100 students got $100 off. No regrets, because for the 3 hours I was in line I was technically making $33.33 an hour, whoot whoot.  Obligatory photo compilation:  Kara P., Yami P., Anna L., and Justin C. This semester, I moved out of East Campus (after moving out of Baker) and into Simmons Hall (where blogger legendary Elizabeth C. '13 lived). You can see the new Simmons 2014 i3 video here. I live in C-Tower, and have pretty much a penthouse view of the Charles. I really love my section, and what's not to love when we were the Scooter Hockey Champions of the first annual simmons competition last week, whazam! Decked out with our retro-neon-game-faces, we scootered our way to viCTory.   Garrett S. '17, Andres A. '17, Evan D. '17, Nick M. '17, Nadia M. '17, Alex D. '17, Sean K. '14,  Christina S. '14, Cosmos D. '15, Hesham '15, and Alison O. (GRT) As a final update, on Friday, Fossil Free MIT revealed a campus-wide statement called the "Blue Line." From their website, it states:  Fossil Free MIT gained permission from MIT Facilities before executing this, and will be removing the tape today. However, this project seemed to gain mixed response from MIT's population, as well as reddit's, which claims: "I'm not sure if wrapping the campus in a petroleum product is the best way to get this message across." I'll update if there is more news soon. This past Friday was the nth annual Tetazoo faculty dinner -  a great event filled with our favorite foods, faculty, staff, random graduate students, and friends! This year we had over 16 different faculty and staff from across MIT, including our very own Chris Peterson!  We decorated the lounge for the occasion, and we spent the whole day cooking in the kitchen preparing food for our favorite professors and instructors!            Pictures of Food                 Baby Marie Our most honored guest was the 1 1/2 year-old baby Marie, the child of our GRTs (Graduate Resident Tutors) who live on our hall.  She got special privileges such as first dibs on food and a special seat outside of the GRT apartment.   The Faculty  Once the faculty started to arrive, we had a greeter at the door to welcome them to our hall.  Most of us were dressed in our hall shirts, featuring our hall mascot, the Squanch!   And we had a special occasion! It was Professor Ron Roscoe's 75th birthday - and he spent it on Tetazoo! We were honored, and Kayla E. '15 made him a beautiful birthday cake, decorated in circuits. We all sang - normally :O - and I think he really enjoyed our celebration and the cake!   And Chris Peterson was there!! I invited him to hang out with the crazy kids he admitted, and I think he had a really good time! Unfortunately, he didn't get to eat any Angel Food Cake. He only got to look at six pieces.    But Petey hated the cats since he is allergic and thinks they are terrible. HOW CAN YOU HATE THIS FACE, PETEY!?  All in all, the nth annual Tetazoo Faculty Dinner event was a huge success, and now we have enough leftovers to last us weeks! Yay not going hungry! After rocking the jeans + sweater/t-shirt look for almost an entire school year, two events occurred last Thursday and Friday that required a slightly more spiffy outfit choice: Ring Delivery (also blogged by Rachel) and the end-of-season fencing banquet. Here are some thoughts if youre into that kind of thing.  The Photography of Ring Delivery: Ridiculous Poses and Pictures of HandsA data summary-esque analysis by Ceri AbstractRing Delivery is a time-honored tradition in which Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) students gather to receive small chunks of molded, semi-precious or precious metal for which they paid large sums of money several months prior. After receiving their ring, colloquially called a Brass Rat, individuals usually feel pride, joy, and a slight sense of dread (or perhaps elation) because they are nearing the end of their sophomore year and the halfway point of their MIT career. This peculiar brew of emotions leads individuals to document their experience in odd ways, especially through very distinct poses and photographs. As such, this study will analyze primary examples of these photographs and attempt to elucidate why such great effort is put into emphasizing the presence of a new piece of jewelry.Materials and MethodsAll photographs were donated by Rachel R. 16. Accompanying figures were digitized using an iPhone 4 camera and created using a Pentel mechanical pencil, an ultra fine point Sharpie marker, and a Tombow N79 brush pen. Results and Figures   Figure 1. Participants pledge allegiance to MIT. This photograph depicts the most common group pose found at Ring Premiere, in which several people smile and hold their ring-bearing hands with flat palms over their chest area. Pictured here are myself, Rachel R. 16, Lauren W. 16, and Nick A. 16, aka two-thirds of the coolest suite to ever have existed (an unbiased assessment). While almost everyone participates in a Ring Premiere photograph of this genre, this may also be the most ridiculous picture from a non-MIT perspective. Clearly the intent of participants is to appear excited for the new status symbols upon their fingers, but each Brass Rat is reduced to but a small glimmer. Participants take a traditional stance with their right hand over the heart region and appear to be pledging allegiance to MIT, a beaver, engineering, IHTFP, stress, Tim the beaver, symbolism, materialism, or some other unknown force. Further study is required to identify to what or to whom they are pledging.   Figure 2. A superhero resides within every MIT student. While a slightly less common pose, oftentimes with smaller groups of 2-3 individuals, this photograph depicts students displaying their rings with clenched fists. Students may smile, as in this example with Alex O. 16 and Rachel R. 16., or adopt a scowl or more serious facial expression to amplify intensity. This genre of picture represents the inner desire to be a superhero within all MIT students. While many would say that these pictures parallel the heroic nature of Tony Stark/Iron Man, MITs celebrity comic book hero, the presence of the Brass Rat in lieu of an arc reactor seems to invoke imagery of the Wonder Twins. The Wonder Twins powers were invoked by forming contact between their rings, at which point Zan (the male) would be able to assume any form of water, and Jayna (the female) would be able to transform into any animal. Perhaps MIT students hope that their rings will bestow similar powers, like knowledge or the ability to transform into an oversized beaver.   Figure 3. Students comMIT to an engagement with a university. This type of photograph is designed to emphasize the details of both the Brass Rat and/or the manicures of the student, as depicted by the hands of Rachel R. '16 and Lesley W. '16. In a similar vein are the pictures of the MIT ring box with the Brass Rat nestled inside; not pictured here. The most common caption to these photographs is some variation on MIT finally put a ring on it, or Engaged to the institute! While this quip is in reference to the fact that most people wear Brass Rats on their right hand ring finger, participants do not appear to consider the extent of this metaphor. Perhaps it is an acknowledgement that life at MIT is like a rocky marriagethe first part of freshman year is the honeymoon phase, but then students end up living in the academic buildings and sleeping on couches, raising stress levels, and investing large sums of money to make the university happy. Eventually, this engagement will end in a divorce, when these students graduate and move on with their lives as a new batch of hopefuls fill their place. Discussion and ConclusionsThrough this study, we have discovered that MIT students are proud of their quest to survive their undergraduate career, and this pride manifests itself in the form of strange photographs upon receiving a status symbol of attending the aforementioned institution. While strange to an outsider, these photographs appear annually on MIT students social media websites around the last week of April. This tradition will most likely continue as long as Brass Rats are being distributed at a Ring Delivery, which, in all predictions, may be many centuries to come. On a separate (totally not giving you whiplash) note, the day immediately following Ring Delivery was the first chance for the fencing sophomores to show off their new rings at a different formal-ish event, the end of the year fencing banquet. To my knowledge, a lot of sports teams have some form of our-seasons-over-but-we-should-eat-food-or-something-because-you-guys-are-cool type event, and this is the fencing teams version. There is food, merriment, gifts for graduating seniors, special award nominations (for example, the Anne Zabladoff Award for Fencing Masochism or most Clueless Sophomore), and paper plate awards for everyone involved with the team. I dont have any particularly snarky commentary re: photos taken at this event, so here are a couple courtesy of Sherry R. 15. Theres a group photo of the entire team + coaches, the (almost entire) foil squad, 5/6 of womens foil (self-proclaimed highest attendance, lowest attention span), and mens foil making fun of womens foil (plus a rogue mens sabre).         As exams become more and more of a reality that I can't ignore, I find my weekly/fortnightly blogs slowly phasing themselves out. As such I thought I'd steal a simple format from the wonderful NPR podcast Pop Culture Happy Hour and just tell you guys a few things that made me happy this week. The rules are simple, what I post needs to be something that you can also enjoy (called the Zaxxon Rule) and the post shan't be too long.  I was lucky enough to see this movie on April 12th(I realize this was a few weeks ago but it's still making me happy), thanks to the early UK release date, and I absolutely loved it. A huge fan of the original three movies (yes, even the third one)  Spider-Man 2 was always one of my favorite movies and this movie knocked it of its throne. While I still feel like Tobey Maguire plays the better Peter Parker, Andrew Garfield has Spider-Man on lock.  A few weeks back my future boss sent me a few books to check out before I started my internship. Sceptical about the title for this one I put off reading it and spent my free time catching up on a few fantasy books. After finishing The Wise Man's Fear I decided to pick it up and enjoy the beautiful Spring weather. What I found was a wonderful book filled with useful tips and dozens of anecdotes of when these simple steps made a big difference in how a few greats, such as Lincoln, Roosevelt and Andrew Carnegie, ran the country and their businesses. This is a must read for anyone who going into an internship this summer.  When Ernesto '15 and I visited Amsterdam a few weeks back one of our stops was at the de Appel Arts Centre where we found a wonderful exhibition about the artist Nina Yuen. I can't put my finger on what it is about the videos but we sat there and patiently watched all 40+ minutes in a trance. The video above, Heather Who, was my favorite of the bunch.  Sarah Kay is without a doubt one of my favorite spoken word poets and her new poem Ghost Ship is a great example why.   And with that I'll finish with asking you guys a simple question, what's making you happy this week? Congratulations to the incoming Class of 2018!  Each and every one of you is incredible, and I am so excited to see your happy faces light up the institute once again in the fall!   So now you've decided to go to MIT, but you haven't paid a dime or picked a class yet. The biggest thing on your plate right now is figuring out when to take the Freshman Essay Evaluation (FEE) or which pre-orientation program to take. Meanwhile, all your other friends are picking out their schedule for the fall. Some of them already know where they are living, and maybe they even entered a randomized lottery to get placed in their basic required classes that everyone else is getting placed in.  MIT is different from other schools. I want to lay out some basics about what you might want or need to know about your freshmen year.  I've learned a lot through my own experiences from my first year at MIT, as well as through being an associate advisor my sophomore year.  Here is my advice! And also some descriptions of what will be required of you as a frosh. Do a Freshman Pre-Orientation Program (FPOP) The applications are due June 15th! SIGN UP FOR AN FPOP!! There is an awesome Mark Twain quote on the FPOP website: "Twenty Years from now you will be more disappointed by the things you didn't do than by the ones you did. So throw off the bowlines. Sail away from the safe harbor. Catch the trade winds in your sails. Explore. Dream."                                       - Mark Twain (1835-1910) I think Mark Twain and MIT admissions painted the right picture for you - FPOPs are a great opportunity for you to do things outside of your comfort zone, and it also is the perfect way for you to start making friends that will last you your four years at MIT and beyond.  The FPOPs range from aerospace to computer science to energy to leadership to exercise to literature to product design and SO MUCH MORE! This year there are twenty-two FPOPs offered in August, and each one gives an amazing introduction to MIT and the beautiful city that surrounds us. My experience includes doing the Freshman Urban Planning FPOP as a frosh, and working as a mentor for the Discover Materials Science & Engineering FPOP.  Each one introduced me to MIT, Cambridge, Boston, and a new group of awesome friends, and I am so grateful for the opportunities! Preservation of the Frosh  Just a few logistics - you are a prefrosh right now, and the 2017s are frosh.  You will not be a frosh and the frosh will not be sophomores until President Reif goes on a giant stage and welcomes you, the Class of 2018, as the freshman class.  President Hockfield never welcomed the Class of 2015 because of bad weather. They are still freshman. This makes sense. The reason why this is how it is and the way it has always be done is because we want to have prefrosh for as long as possible, and there must always be a freshman class, and while sophomores become juniors and juniors become seniors and seniors become crufty, sophomores don't need to be conserved. Only you, the prefrosh or frosh of MIT, must be conserved. Take HASS Classes! Now into some academics - I'll briefly explain the HASS system here at MIT. You are required to take eight HASS - humanities, arts, and social sciences - classes during your time here at MIT.  Of those eight classes, you must take at least one humanities, one arts, and one social sciences class. You must also fulfill a HASS concentration, which involves taking 3-4 classes in a certain subject. For example, I plan on concentrating in writing poetry, which involves me taking a few poetry workshop classes and a reading poetry class. TAKE A HASS CLASS YOUR FIRST SEMESTER! Take at least one HASS class EACH semester!!  I have made this mistake twice and I cannot emphasize it enough.  Taking four (or five) technical classes is extremely difficult, and might drive you insane.  I understand that you might want to take all your required GIRs first semester since you are on Pass/No Record and don't want to have to worry about getting a good grade in these really difficult classes.  But this leads me to my next point... Pass/No Record is NOT an excuse to get a C- in every class You will hear "A=B=C=P," and it might be true when it comes down to a transcript, but it is not true when it comes to challenging yourself and figuring out what it takes to get an A in a class at MIT.  Aim high and try the hardest you can in your classes - the semester will be over more quickly than you know, and you will have to take graded classes based on the information you learned in your Pass/No Record classes.  If you didn't learn any information, then you really are going to be sad in the following semesters.  Use Pass/No Record to your advantage by seeing how much you can handle on your plate in addition to your classes.  Join a club sport or class council or rush a fraternity (and steal all their food and then come to East Campus)  and use this time to become close with the people around you.  Watch how you can allocate your time to still do well in your classes while being involved on campus, and make sure that you are not overcommitting to too much.  Pass/No Record is not an excuse to not try in your classes, but it is an excuse to go outside your comfort zone to figure out what it takes to live a balanced life at MIT.  People say "Social Life, Classes, Sleep - pick two." But you can have all three, even at a place with incredibly difficult and time-consuming classes like MIT. Classes to take your Freshman Year So you have to take a HASS class and you have to do your best in your classes - but what should those classes be?  I'm going to highlight the technical class options you have for your freshman year. All MIT students must complete a total of 17 General Institute Requirements, or GIRs.  It is possible to get out of some of these GIRs through AP credit or through passing an Advanced Standing Exam (ASE), which is basically like taking the final of the class right at the bat of the semester.  At any other time, the grade you get on an ASE would show up on your transcript. As a freshman on Pass/No Record, if you pass the ASE, you get a P! They have extended the offered biology classes from my year to include four different types of introductory classes that fulfill the biology requirement: 7.012, 7.013, 7014, and 7.016.  In the fall, you can take either 7.012 or 7.016. 7.013 and 7.014 are offered in the spring.  All of these classes cover the same fundamental principles of biochemistry, genetics, molecular and cell biology.  However, they each focus on a different one of these.   I recommend taking biology in the fall if you feel confident in your chemistry abilities, and in the spring if you do not.  I took biology at the same time as my chemistry class, and it did feel quite overwhelming at times.  Definitely try to split them apart so you can focus on them individually. Here at MIT, you are required to take single-variable (18.01) and multi-variable (18.02) calculus.  There are different versions of each that you can take, and my advice is to take the slightly harder version of whatever you feel comfortable with, that way you can drop down to a different version of the class if you decide that it is too difficult.  I would also recommend doing whichever track allows you to take 18.03, or differential equations, in the spring, although this might not be feasible for people who want to take 18.014 and 18.024, which are advanced classes that focus on calculus with theory.  18.03 is not a GIR (contrary to popular belief), but many, if not most, majors have it as a requirement.  It also is an extremely difficult and important class, and it is very necessary to have a strong math background before taking it. So if you ASE or AP out of 18.01, congratulations! Take 18.02 or 18.014. If you do not ASE or AP out of 18.01, taking 18.01 is fine, but consider taking 18.01A/18.02A.  This class involves a six-week review of single-variable claculus, and then 18.02 taken at the regular pace, which continues into IAP (Independent Activities Period during January).  Besides, if you start out taking 18.01A, it is perfectly fine and acceptable to drop down to 18.01 if it ends up being too difficult. Challenge yourself! Freshman year is all about discovering what your limits are - if 18.01A extends beyond your limits, that is okay! It does not mean you are any less smart than any of your peers or that you don't belong at MIT, it just means that maybe you weren't quite ready for that class. I am biased because I am course 3 (materials science and engineering), but TAKE 3.091!! Okay now I am going to be honest - you will have the option to take one of the following: 5.111, 5.112, or 3.091.  5.111 (pronounced five-eleven-one) is basic chemistry, with slightly more focus on liquid-state materials.  5.112 (pronounced five-eleven-two) is a bit more advanced version of 5.111, and covers additional materials that might help you if you plan on majoring in chemistry or becoming pre-med.  3.091 (pronounced three-oh-nine-one) focuses on solid-state materials, which I think are extremely interesting and I thought that the class was very well taught.  You might have heard rumors about 3.091 in the fall having no tests and, as a result, being quite disorganized and/or terrible.  However, this fall, 3.091 is going to be taught in the traditional way with tests (and hopefully no attendance grade) and small quizzes and the really great Professor Cima, and it will be an awesome class! Take it! Learn about phase diagrams and chocolate and materials! Yay materials! Yay polymers! The other day, I got a facebook message from the lovely Kimia Z. '18 asking about first semester physics, which is mechanics. She told me that her school has a very weak physics program, and she wanted to know if I would recommend she try to take classes over the summer. I told her that if you don't feel confident in your physics skills, I highly recommend taking 8.01L in the fall.  The class has the same content as 8.01, but it is taught over a longer period of time and in lecture style instead of in TEAL sessions, where you learn about a concept and immediately do a problem about it on whiteboards around the room in groups.  8.01L consists of the fall semester and IAP, and it was completely worth taking 8.01L for me and I felt a lot more confident about my physics skills moving at the slower pace than I would have in 8.01 TEAL. If you do feel uncomfortable with your physics background and want to take 8.01 anyway, that is perfectly fine, and again, you can always switch it to 8.01L later. And if you want to review concepts before classes start, MIT opencourseware is an amazing resource! The other requirement is 8.02, which is about electrical and magnetic properties in physics.  This is also taught in TEAL style, however, if you feel super confident in your physics abilities, you can choose to take 8.012 and 8.022 in the fall and spring respectively, which are advanced versions of each of the classes, taught in lecture style. Many of my friends on Tetazoo did this track, and they really enjoyed the classes and are now planning on double majoring in physics! Will L. '16 described the difference - "8.012 and 8.022 are good for showing what course 8 is like at MIT. 8.01 and 8.02 are more engineering classes." I mentioned the HASS requirement earlier, but in addition to taking 8 HASS classes, two of those classes must be communication intensive classes. Depending on if you get out of taking the FEE or if you pass it, you will either have to take a CI-H (communication intensive humanities class) or a CI-HW (communication intensive humanities writing class) your freshman year.  These classes involve writing a couple essays, writing a revision for one of those essays, and writing a big paper at the end. I don't like papers.  I took Bioethics (24.06) my freshman spring and it was okay. I'm doing anything I can to procrastinate taking another CI-H. Don't procrastinate!! The HASS classes are all listed on the internet with the other classes. That's all great... but when do I actually pick out my classes? In the fall! When you get here for your pre-orientation program, you are going to check into your temporary room in your temporary dorm, and you are going to spend many hours of many days at your FPOP having fun. After the final day of your FPOP, you will check in with your orientation leader.  (Quick note - Orientation activities are optional.)  This is the week that you will meet with your advisor and your associate advisor(s), and they will help you sort out your final schedule. It is nice to have some sort of plan on what you want to take, but that is not at all necessary.  You will very likely get the classes you want to take.  This leads me to my next point... Meet your Advising Team! Free food! Woo advising teams! I was an associate advisor this past year, and it was my duty, along with a faculty advisor, to help my advisees choose a path that was right for them. My advice to you is to keep in touch with your advising team - we are a great resource for you to reach out to in case of trouble with choosing classes or doing well in classes or life or anything else at all!  Come ask us questions! We will send you care packages and take you to get ice cream and more! As far as choosing freshman advising, there are two main options. You can choose advising that involves credit such as a learning community, or advising that offers no credit like traditional advising.  There is also residence based advising in some dorms, but, in my personal opinion, this system is a little unfair because it requires you to be stuck in your dorm for a full year, even if you decide that it is not the place for you.  Please keep this in mind when choosing which dorm you want to live in, because this can be a big commitment.  The dorms that have RBA are Maseeh, McCormick, Next House, Chocolate City, and Spanish House.  So if you know that these are the places that you want to live in forever and ever, go ahead! Put them as your first choice! But, be forewarned, if it turns out that the place isn't all you thought it was, you are stuck! (These are my opinions - there are many people who end up loving their dorm and the residence based advising programs!) I am a big fan of traditional advising, which just makes it so that your advisor is there for you when you need them, if you need them, and same with your associate advisor.  But all in all, your biggest source of information will be the upperclassmen on campus that you live with, work with, eat with, and are friends with. So come talk to us, we don't bite! And feel free to ask me questions anytime - comment below or come visit me during rush in East Campus! I'll dye your head a strange color! Or all the colors! Take Physical Education Classes EARLY. TAKE THE SWIM TEST! You just got here. It's day one of orientation, and you're signed up for the 12pm swim test.  But you're sleepy. You rather sleep. Sleep sleep sleep. GET UP! Go take the swim test! There are some people who wait until right before they graduate to take the swim test - don't do that! If you fail, you don't get to graduate from MIT. You have to wait another semester. Don't do that!!  If you don't feel comfortable swimming, that is okay! Take the swim physical education class right away! Don't save these required things for your senior year, because you only need to miss a few PE classes to fail one. Also, people will tell you that you need to complete the physical education requirement by your sophomore year. This is not true. Sometimes, you just cannot fit a PE class into your schedule - that is completely understandable. But try to spread out taking the classes, or at least a couple of the four required PE classes, during your freshman year while you have the time to do so.  And take the swim test! Do it!! Take advantage of REX! IT IS CPW ALL OVER AGAIN - BUT EVEN BETTER! Orientation - AKA Rush - is another time when we, the denizens of East Campus, as well as all other living groups around campus do everything in our/their power to convince you that our/their dorm is the best dorm and that you should live here/there!  I will post a lot of pictures in the fall of the awesome activities (including roller coaster building!) happening around East Campus, but do your best to visit every single dorm on campus, steal all the free food, and have a great time! Make new friends, build awesome things, eat great food, and have the time of your life before classes start and consume us all. I hope my little tidbits of advice are helpful!

And, of course, a... read more  see complete archives   Below is one of the robots I built for 2.007, MIT's extremely popular introductory design and manufacturing class:    For reference, here's the first "robot" I ever built, on the first day of 2.007:  Before I took 2.007, I hadn't ever used a mill or lathe.  I wasn't sure what it meant to tap a hole. Heck, I'd never used a power drill before.  But four months later, I was comfortable with all of these tools, thanks in large part to the awesome shop guys (particularly Bill and Tasker). I built my first gearbox and learned how to use fast fabrication methods.  And I built a pair of robots that actually did quite well in the competition!  It's been a lot of fun.  Here's a rough summary of the past few months: 2.007 is well known for its chaos and intensity, and it's intimidating to be told that by the end of this class you'll be building a Robot, capital 'R', and competing against your peers, many of whom have had years of FIRST robotics experience.  Suddenly you're faced with design decisions, big scary machine tools that you're not entirely comfortable turning on, part choices, and Arduinos, maybe even before you know what gears and bearings and linkages are. So what do you do?  Like any good engineer, break it up into smaller, more manageable pieces.  Our first assignment is to build a "Mini Me" robot that can drive around from a basic list of materials.  By the end of lab, I've bandsawed the glorified bent piece of plastic above and stuck 2 motors + an RC receiver on it.  It's not pretty, but it drives. At the end of lab, my (awesome) lab instructor Chip reminds us to always fasten our wheels, because loose wheels have tripped up many a top competitor before.  ~~~foreshadowing alert~~~ This year's robot competition is ski-themed - MITSKI! The instructors have build this cool course consisting of three different hills of different grades, with flags to pull, medals to collect, and trophies to pull.  Quickly it becomes apparent that the most efficient way to score points is to do laps on the extremely steep 60 degree top hill (in hindsight, I wish they had made flag pulling worth more points, as it would have led to more interesting robot mechanisms).  It's not a trivial problem to solve.  Because of the steepness of the hill, tipping is a problem.  Because of the slippery surface material, slipping is also a problem. As Richard Hammond from Top Gear tells us in a recorded video, "keep your centers of gravity low and your coefficients of friction high." For several days I iterate and iterate on a design (nicknamed "Spatula Bot") that tries to climb the steep hill by keeping my center of gravity extremely low.  It works, kind of; it's extremely slow up the slope, far too slow to have any hope of running multiple laps during the 120 second competition period.  Notice that I'm making extensive use of waterjetting sheet metal to make precise, elegant parts; thanks to my friend Emma S. '16 for her help waterjetting!  Amusingly, one of the robots on the final day is named "Flagrant Abuse of the Waterjet", a title that would have been accurate for my robots. Major credit goes to Josh B. '16, as he designs the first robot capable of quickly climbing the top hill, using a rail gripper.  His design ends up strongly influencing the rest of the field's hill climbers as well.  Here's a CAD of one of my early successful prototypes utilizing a "ski gripper", v2 of what eventually becomes my Ascensionist robot:  The RC controllers and Playstation controllers provided by 2.007 aren't terribly reliable or easy to use.  I decide early on to use my iPhone and iPad to control my robots via OSC, a wireless protocol usually used by DJs to connect to sound synthesizers.  This has the advantage of letting me avoid the bottleneck of waiting for available RC controllers later in the semester.  I briefly toy around with the idea of making a robot with large diameter wheels that drives equally well upside down, and build a few prototypes.  But the high speed motors I'm using don't have enough torque to drive the large wheels up the top hill, and I decide to revert to a strategy of building roll bars:  And this ends up being very similar to my final design; I also lower my entire chassis and use a 3D printed fixture to mount my motors.  Early on I discovered that tumbling down the top hill easily damages the delicate high speed motors I'm using.  My 3D printed mounts work well, and soon after lots of people are using them for their robots as well. As you can see from the propagation of Josh's rail gripper idea and my 3D printed motor mounts, ideas spread fast in 2.007.  That's the way it's designed: even though you're building your robot as an individual, especially for beginner builders it's essential to collaborate and work with other people.  Forget about "helping the competition"; working together and seeing what designs work (and just as important, which designs don't work) will save loads of time and lead to better robots for everyone. Plus, these are your peers, who you'll be working together with in 2.008, 2.009, and other team projects.  Don't burn your bridges by being petty and accusing people of "stealing" your general ideas.  This ain't Apple vs. Samsung. I've got my hill climbing robot mostly done, but I also want to build a robot that pulls down the multiplier.  But there's no way I'll be able to design, fabricate, and test an additional robot in 1 week.  Is there? One of the most underutilized resources in 2.007 (in my opinion) is a document called "How To Build Your Everything Really Really Fast".  It's written by Charles Guan, who now teaches the electric gokart special section of 2.007 (see, "it doesn't have to be a robot"), and goes into lots of fast fabrication techniques. Robust robot designs generally require a lot of right angles; with traditional fabrication techniques this can involve lots of milling and drilling precise holes.  But using waterjetting and fastener techniques like "t-nuts", you can save a lot of time and throw together fairly complicated robots quickly. A task that would have seemed impossible for me at the beginning of the semester, but thanks to Tasker and Steve (the shop guys in charge of the waterjet and lasercutter) I'm able to do it.  Here's the gearbox that eventually goes into the robot at the top of this page:  Note the extensive use of standoffs and t-nuts.  This makes my multiplier bot extremely modular; I'm able to completely disassemble and iterate my chassis and gearbox design in minutes, as opposed to hours.  Here's the final design of my 2 robots:  My hill climber robot scores enough points to seed me 2nd in the tournament (behind the aforementioned Josh), which means that I have a guaranteed spot on the final day of competition, and get to relax and watch the preliminaries. Then competition day comes, and it's totally awesome.  Besides the robots, there's this "Engineering Petting Zoo" showcasing cool machines from companies and students.  Among the stuff featured: Tony Stewart's NASCAR racecar, a Corvette, and electric gokarts built by the 2.007 alternate section. But the robots are the main attraction of the day, of course.  I'm able to cruise through the first few rounds of competition despite my hill climber flipping over, thanks to my multiplier bot.  Clockwise from top left: me controlling my hill climber via iPhone, Josh's hill climber + medal grabber bot, Danny (one of the lab instructors) and his Ski Patrol outfit, my multiplier bot in action.  Photo credits to Landon C. '17. But robustness is key, and one of my hill climber's wheels pops off in the final 8 round. I knew I should have listened to Chip and remembered to screw those wheels on.  An unfortunate time to learn that lesson, but I still have a lot of fun watching the final 4 duke it out. The final match, between Josh B. '16 and Clare Z. '16 proves to be especially exciting.  Josh's pair of autonomous robots has performed well all night and is capable of scoring well over 600 points - but Clare's manually controlled robot is crucially super robust and reliable.  In a huge upset, Josh's hill climber gets stuck in a rut, meaning his multiplier bot isn't able to push the trophy, and Clare wins with a score of 312.   Clare winning the gold trophy, next to Professor Sangbae Kim and Professor Amos Winter.  Photo credit to Landon C. '17. A thrilling end to the night, and a great way to cap off my favorite class at MIT so far.  I can't wait to take 2.008 and 2.009! Week 1: Spider-Man, Nina Yuen, and More! The concept is simple, users ask the question "What if x piece of history was different" and the more historically inclined Redditors construct an argument, with sources, about what would have happened. Here are a few of my favorite questions. "How would modern American football players fare in an ancient world?" "What if Afghanistan was never invaded by the United Front and the Taliban regime continued to conquer all of Afghanistan?" "What would allow the Roman Empire to last until today?"  A few months back I discovered the Geek And Sundry Youtube series of TableTop and I fell in love. Every week Wil Wheaton would gather a few of his celebrity friends and play a new Board/Card/Role-Playing game. The show was funny, the games were interesting, and it helped kindle a deep love of TableTop gaming. I burnt through all of the episodes in about a week or two and word on the street was that they were going to try to Crowdfund season 3. After a few weeks of doing just that, they've exceeded their goals and will be able to make 20 episodes and a Role-Playing Game show. I can't wait!   Net Neutrality is a topic that I've been closely following for a while now. The decision that the FCC makes will have a large impact on my future career and it's nice to see Youtubers spreading the word.  A few weeks back I started taking Complexity Theory and it has quickly risen through the ranks of my favorite classes this year. Every lecture has been better than the one before and the world of P vs. NP is slowly making sense. Apologies for breaking the Zaxxon rule with this one but it's been a while since a series of lectures was this interesting. Click HERE for a nice ELI10 of the problem.  After reading through The Name of the Wind/A Wise Man's Fear during Christmas break I started looking around for more fantasy books to fill my time and picked up The Blade Itself (Book 1 of The First Law trilogy). Whereas most of the books I loved before coming to MIT were Young Adult I decided to move to the more mature end of the spectrum. I've been reading The Blade Itself sporadically since December but it was becoming increasingly difficult to remember names or what's going on. So lately I've been waking up a little bit early to read every morning and I absolutely love the book.    And with that I'll finish asking you guys a simple question, what's making you happy this week? Trouble thinking up a good Kerberos username? Take some hints from Batman.                           Earlier this week, Morgan O. (G) invited MIT EMS and our campus police officers (who unfortunately could not attend) to see the place where she works - the roof of the Green Building!  The Green Building is the tallest building in Cambridge - 19 stories tall and on stilts at 277 feet!  She brought up her giant telescope and we looked at the moon, Mars, Jupiter and more! The view from the Green Building, the home of MIT's Earth and Planetary Scienes department, was absolutely gorgeous!  Lawrence W. (G) brought his really pretty camera and I brought mine, and we had some fun with them on the roof!   Adam S. '14 wanted a photo of him in front of the fanastic Boston skyline, and it wasn't long before everyone wanted their shot in front of the view!          In the end, we had a wonderful time, and we were all so glad that Morgan brought us up there to see Boston and Cambridge from a completely new perspective.  see complete archives  Today we're releasing our decisions regarding transfer applicants who applied for admission for Fall 2014. Transfer applicants, unlike freshman applicants, receive decisions via email from our office to the address listed on their application. The emails will be sent at 5 PM Eastern today, May 7, and you should receive it shortly thereafter, depending on the traffic in the tubes. Our transfer admissions process was quite competitive. As in past years, hundreds of students applied, and we only had space to admit fewer than 20 students. It is a difficult process: as usual, we are very excited about the students we have admitted, and often chagrined about those we could not. As a former transfer student myself, I know that this process can be a complicated one. For those of you who were admitted: welcome to MIT. For those who weren't: I wish you the best of luck. I transferred, but if I hadn't things would have been fine. Remember, college is mostly what you make of it, here or anywhere else; if you weren't one of those students whom we admitted, I wish you the best of luck wherever you go (or stay).  You: Where are you from?Me: London.You: But you...you don't...you don't seem to have a British accent.Me: Correct. Let me explain!

To be fair, hes a name rather than a face for most of us: the PhD physicist-turned-politician, one of two physicists in Congress, now the US Representative for New Jerseys 12th congressional district. I happen to know what he looks like because an assistant addressed him by name when I passed by in the hallway.  Now, Im in a big room scarfing down bacon and coffee with over a hundred other representatives from science and engineering organizations, waiting for Rep. Holt to give a speech. And now that the Congressman is physically in the room, the internal conflict begins. I think, I will probably never have the chance to meet Rush Holt ever again. Then I think, I have nothing to say to Rush Holt, and he probably doesnt have anything to say to me since Im not one of his constituents, and the last time I was in New Jersey I was repulsed by the smell of industrial fumes along the New Jersey Turnpike. Finally, I gather my wits and conclude, Who cares? So, I walk over to where Rush Holt is standing. Well, actually, I walk up to Rep Holts staffer (Sean) and thank him for giving such a helpful presentation at the AAAS yesterday. While Sean and I are talking, Congressman Holt walks up to me. Rush Holt: Hi, Im Rush Holt.Um, no kidding. Me: Im Anna Ho. Im an undergraduate at MIT majoring in physics.Rush Holt: Physics!Me: Yes, I gather that we have something in common!Oh, dear. Someone sound the socially awkward alarm.Rush Holt: Who do you work with at MIT?Is Rush Holt intimately familiar with MITs physics department...? I give him a few names. He asks where Im from and what my research is about. We talk about pulsars, and at some point Rush Holt says "yes, I know what pulsars are. I'm a physicist!" At this point, a number of people are trying to get Rep. Holts attention, to tell him that its speech time. I excuse myself and go sit with the rest of the American Astronomical Society delegation, as the Congressman heads to the podium.  I miss his first few sentences, because I'm busy wondering how many people can say that they've talked to a Congressman about pulsars. *     *     * The United States House of Representatives occupies three office buildings along Independence Avenue. Breakfast with Rush Holt took place in one of them. We arrived there at 7:30am and waited in a long line to walk through metal detectors. The nice view of the Capitol Building nearly made up for the fact that it was FREEZING outside (Dear Washington DC: that was a pitiful excuse for Spring.)  Ive been on Capitol Hill for two days. Two days were enough to learn that things here unfold on VERY SHORT TIMESCALES. Yesterday, for example, we learned about a proposal to raise the FY 2015 NSF (National Science Foundation) budget from $7.25 billion to $7.5 billion. We were encouraged to urge our representatives to sign onto this letter. In order to urge intelligently, we had to memorize the following: its a Dear Colleague letter addressed to Chairman Frank Wolf and ranking member Chaka Fattah of the House CJS Appropriations Subcommittee, Congressman Butterfields office is leading the letter, the staff contact is Dennis Sills, and the deadline for signing is 1pm March 27. We are meeting with our representatives today, and March 27 is tomorrow. My team is comprised of myself, a graduate student from Georgia Tech, and an astronomer from the Harvard-Smithsonian Institute for Astrophysics. This is our schedule for the day: 9:00 AM Representative Katherine Clark (Massachusetts)10:00 AM Representative John Lewis (Georgia)10:30 AM Representative Michael Capuano (Massachusetts)- lunch, presumably -1:00 PM Senator Elizabeth Warren (Massachusetts)1:30 PM Senator Saxby Chambliss (Georgia)2:00 PM Senator Ed Markey (Massachusetts)2:30 PM Senator Johnny Isakson (Georgia) Im in charge of the meetings with Representative Capuano and Senator Markey. I secured our appointments through a combination of e-mail exchanges and embarrassing phone conversations. Now, its 8:30am and time to find Rep Clarks office. I hyperventilate a little bit and skim my notes from yesterday. My name is Anna Ho, and Im a constituent living in Cambridge. Im a senior at MIT majoring in physics, but today Im here representing the American Astronomical Society. In the fall, Im going to start a PhD program in astronomy  but when I started college, I didnt think that I was cut out to be a research scientist. The summer after my sophomore year, I did an internship funded by the National Science Foundation. I loved it so much that I went back the next summer and did it again. I learned that I wanted to do research because I had the opportunity to try doing research. And I had that opportunity because of this program. I became a scientist because of this program, and I would be very happy to tell you more about it.  *     *     * You can learn a lot about a politician by looking around his office. For example, Representative John Lewis was one of the leaders of the African-American Civil Rights Movement, and you could probably piece this together from the shelves full of awards and medals. A Martin Luther King Jr. Dr. sign hangs over one of the big wooden doors, with the following quote: Public officers are the trustees and servants of the people who are at all times amenable to them. There are Coca Cola bottles everywhere. We had a similar experience in Senator Chamblisss office later in the afternoon; apparently this is a Georgia Thing. Another Georgia Thing is peanuts. Peanut bowls in both offices prompted my Georgia Tech teammate to exclaim Georgia peanuts! Similarly, stepping into Representative Capuanos office feels  at least, to this Massachusetts resident  bizarrely like stepping into a museum of home. The first thing I notice is an MIT flag on the wall, dangling with flags from all of District 7s many universities and colleges. The tables are covered with editions of the New England Journal of Medicine and local newspapers. On the wall is a picture of Jordan Hall, where I once went to watch Davie 12 sing Mendelssohns oratorio Elijah, as well as a plaque about Reach Out, an organization I volunteered with as an MIT freshman. Senator Markeys office is less home-y, so while waiting for our meeting to start I sit on the long dark red couch and stare at framed pictures: over the fireplace, Markey with Obama and Markey with Ted Kennedy, on a table to my right, Markey with Obama and Nancy Pelosi, and by the door, an aerial picture of Boston and the Charles, MIT just out of sight. *     *     * We meet with Representatives in the morning, eat lunch, then meet with Senators in the afternoon. We stand up when the staffer enters, shake hands, introduce ourselves, sit around a table. When its my turn to lead the meeting, I tell the staffer about NSF-funded research internships for undergraduates (REUs), and how having the opportunity to do science research over the summer is what made me decide to go into science research as a career. Nicole (from Georgia Tech) chimes in to say that she did an REU as an undergraduate as well, and that its also what inspired her to continue in science. Kelly (from Harvard-Smithsonian) then explains that she did an REU as an undergraduate and now runs a Solar Physics REU. I emphasize that NSF funding is crucial not just for building telescope facilities and paying researchers, but also for maintaining these important educational programs. Rep. Capuanos staffer is very interested; he pulls out a notebook, writes down the name of the program, takes notes on what were saying. He tells us that Capuanos office is totally on board with all this science funding stuff, that theyve already signed onto the NSF Dear Colleague letter, that having anecdotes like this from us is very helpful as they try to convince others to do the same. In between meetings and on the way to lunch, we walk through underground tunnels and keep an eye out for Congressmen, who are identifiable by the pins they wear. We run into Michele Bachmann while waiting for an elevator and catch a glimpse of Ted Cruz. We split up after lunch and I head over alone to the Senate building. Theres a long line inside the Senate Cafe; I sit at a table holding Paradise Lost, watching white shirts and pastel-colored ties flash by. The cafe is full of handshakes and sandwiches are tossed into paper boxes. No one seems to have time to sit and eat. And now, the Senate meetings. Turns out that Elizabeth Warren is holding a meet-and-greet:  That afternoon, there is only one moment that (initially) feels like a disaster. We're sitting with Sen. Markeys staffer, Dan, and I'm running the meeting. Dan has a PhD in physics and worked at the LHC for a while, and makes it clear from the start that his office is already on board. My brain says you have an action item! and my mouth starts moving on autopilot: My Mouth: Has Sen. Markey signed onto the Dear Colleague letter circulating in the House?Dan: ...Well, thats in the House, and were the Senate.My Brain: NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO WHY ANNA WHY Thinking quickly,Me: Well, is there an equivalent letter in the Senate?Dan: No, but I would be happy to start one. Wait, what? Dan: Its really helpful when scientists come in and give concrete suggestions for legislation they want to see. Wait, you want us to do that? Does anybody realize this? Does anybody understand the system well enough to even know what to ask for? Dan asks us to e-mail him the House letter. Still in shock, I offer my contact information as usual. Dan says that he will actually be in Cambridge in a few weeks, and would be happy to take me up on the offer of an MIT tour. A week later, Josh Shiode e-mails the AAS delegation saying Thanks to one of our teams, Senator Markeys office is leading a Dear Colleague letter in the Senate that closely mirrors the one in the House in support of $7.5 billion for NSF in FY 2015. Please send the below text and attached pdf to each of your Senate contacts and urge them to sign on to support this effort. A couple of days later, Dan e-mails me to say that the letter is circulating and 11 senators have signed on so far. Thought youd like to know! A week after that, I meet Dan in MIT's Lobby 7. Hansol '15 gives us a tour of Prof. Brad Pentelute's chemistry lab and two graduate students show us around the Man-Vehicle Lab. Between labs (getting around MIT involves a lot of walking) Dan and I discuss how to get scientists more involved in advocacy, and what a scientist's role in advocacy is in the first place. Eventually, Dan has to go get work done so I drop him off at the Stata Center. We shake hands, and I say that I'll be in touch. I mean it.  The first speech I ever gave in my life was to the 1000 of you who attended the CPW Welcome event Thursday night. It was a 5 minute, 5 step guide on "How to Do CPW", and I heard it was "amusing" though I was really going for inspirational and life-changing. Here's a gif in case you missed it:  At the time, I actually didnt know that there was a major difference since my CPW: THE EVENTS DIDNT GO PAST 2 AM. At least not officially. Come on MIT, what is that? Its breaking tradition to not have events registered around the clock. It made enough people upset that prefrosh might potentially get too much sleep, that I think its reverting back to a 24/7 schedule next year.   During CPW, there were little stations installed where you could fold cranes from white paper. I noticed them filling up over the weekend, though I didnt take a closer look. The end result? A HACK!! It was raised from the ceiling of Stata the night before the one-year memorial of Officer Sean Collier. It was such a stunning and poignant tribute that some people didn't realize it was a hack. I really commend those who put it together.  Then came Ring Delivery, which was the day after I went to an Iggy Azalea concert. Honestly, freshman year, I wasn't particularly interested in the brass rat. I thought "I don't like wearing jewelry, and anyway, it's expensive." Ive changed my mind since then, and think it is a genuinely special object due to its symbolism. As for the finances, I heard RingComm had funds left over that they were turning into subsidies for students. This was already demonstrated at Ring Premiere, because the first person in line won a free ring (hint for future years!). So as the rumor went, you had to get in line early for ring sales to get a subsidy. Therefore, Cara L. and I woke up at 6:30 am on a Saturday to get in line for 10 am sales: we were the 6th and 7th people in line! Turns out we didnt need to be so early because the first 100 students got $100 off. No regrets, because for the 3 hours I was in line I was technically making $33.33 an hour, whoot whoot.  Obligatory photo compilation:  Kara P., Yami P., Anna L., and Justin C. This semester, I moved out of East Campus (after moving out of Baker) and into Simmons Hall (where blogger legendary Elizabeth C. '13 lived). You can see the new Simmons 2014 i3 video here. I live in C-Tower, and have pretty much a penthouse view of the Charles. I really love my section, and what's not to love when we were the Scooter Hockey Champions of the first annual simmons competition last week, whazam! Decked out with our retro-neon-game-faces, we scootered our way to viCTory.   Garrett S. '17, Andres A. '17, Evan D. '17, Nick M. '17, Nadia M. '17, Alex D. '17, Sean K. '14,  Christina S. '14, Cosmos D. '15, Hesham '15, and Alison O. (GRT) As a final update, on Friday, Fossil Free MIT revealed a campus-wide statement called the "Blue Line." From their website, it states:  Fossil Free MIT gained permission from MIT Facilities before executing this, and will be removing the tape today. However, this project seemed to gain mixed response from MIT's population, as well as reddit's, which claims: "I'm not sure if wrapping the campus in a petroleum product is the best way to get this message across." I'll update if there is more news soon. This past Friday was the nth annual Tetazoo faculty dinner -  a great event filled with our favorite foods, faculty, staff, random graduate students, and friends! This year we had over 16 different faculty and staff from across MIT, including our very own Chris Peterson!  We decorated the lounge for the occasion, and we spent the whole day cooking in the kitchen preparing food for our favorite professors and instructors!            Pictures of Food                 Baby Marie Our most honored guest was the 1 1/2 year-old baby Marie, the child of our GRTs (Graduate Resident Tutors) who live on our hall.  She got special privileges such as first dibs on food and a special seat outside of the GRT apartment.   The Faculty  Once the faculty started to arrive, we had a greeter at the door to welcome them to our hall.  Most of us were dressed in our hall shirts, featuring our hall mascot, the Squanch!   And we had a special occasion! It was Professor Ron Roscoe's 75th birthday - and he spent it on Tetazoo! We were honored, and Kayla E. '15 made him a beautiful birthday cake, decorated in circuits. We all sang - normally :O - and I think he really enjoyed our celebration and the cake!   And Chris Peterson was there!! I invited him to hang out with the crazy kids he admitted, and I think he had a really good time! Unfortunately, he didn't get to eat any Angel Food Cake. He only got to look at six pieces.    But Petey hated the cats since he is allergic and thinks they are terrible. HOW CAN YOU HATE THIS FACE, PETEY!?  All in all, the nth annual Tetazoo Faculty Dinner event was a huge success, and now we have enough leftovers to last us weeks! Yay not going hungry! After rocking the jeans + sweater/t-shirt look for almost an entire school year, two events occurred last Thursday and Friday that required a slightly more spiffy outfit choice: Ring Delivery (also blogged by Rachel) and the end-of-season fencing banquet. Here are some thoughts if youre into that kind of thing.  The Photography of Ring Delivery: Ridiculous Poses and Pictures of HandsA data summary-esque analysis by Ceri AbstractRing Delivery is a time-honored tradition in which Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) students gather to receive small chunks of molded, semi-precious or precious metal for which they paid large sums of money several months prior. After receiving their ring, colloquially called a Brass Rat, individuals usually feel pride, joy, and a slight sense of dread (or perhaps elation) because they are nearing the end of their sophomore year and the halfway point of their MIT career. This peculiar brew of emotions leads individuals to document their experience in odd ways, especially through very distinct poses and photographs. As such, this study will analyze primary examples of these photographs and attempt to elucidate why such great effort is put into emphasizing the presence of a new piece of jewelry.Materials and MethodsAll photographs were donated by Rachel R. 16. Accompanying figures were digitized using an iPhone 4 camera and created using a Pentel mechanical pencil, an ultra fine point Sharpie marker, and a Tombow N79 brush pen. Results and Figures   Figure 1. Participants pledge allegiance to MIT. This photograph depicts the most common group pose found at Ring Premiere, in which several people smile and hold their ring-bearing hands with flat palms over their chest area. Pictured here are myself, Rachel R. 16, Lauren W. 16, and Nick A. 16, aka two-thirds of the coolest suite to ever have existed (an unbiased assessment). While almost everyone participates in a Ring Premiere photograph of this genre, this may also be the most ridiculous picture from a non-MIT perspective. Clearly the intent of participants is to appear excited for the new status symbols upon their fingers, but each Brass Rat is reduced to but a small glimmer. Participants take a traditional stance with their right hand over the heart region and appear to be pledging allegiance to MIT, a beaver, engineering, IHTFP, stress, Tim the beaver, symbolism, materialism, or some other unknown force. Further study is required to identify to what or to whom they are pledging.   Figure 2. A superhero resides within every MIT student. While a slightly less common pose, oftentimes with smaller groups of 2-3 individuals, this photograph depicts students displaying their rings with clenched fists. Students may smile, as in this example with Alex O. 16 and Rachel R. 16., or adopt a scowl or more serious facial expression to amplify intensity. This genre of picture represents the inner desire to be a superhero within all MIT students. While many would say that these pictures parallel the heroic nature of Tony Stark/Iron Man, MITs celebrity comic book hero, the presence of the Brass Rat in lieu of an arc reactor seems to invoke imagery of the Wonder Twins. The Wonder Twins powers were invoked by forming contact between their rings, at which point Zan (the male) would be able to assume any form of water, and Jayna (the female) would be able to transform into any animal. Perhaps MIT students hope that their rings will bestow similar powers, like knowledge or the ability to transform into an oversized beaver.   Figure 3. Students comMIT to an engagement with a university. This type of photograph is designed to emphasize the details of both the Brass Rat and/or the manicures of the student, as depicted by the hands of Rachel R. '16 and Lesley W. '16. In a similar vein are the pictures of the MIT ring box with the Brass Rat nestled inside; not pictured here. The most common caption to these photographs is some variation on MIT finally put a ring on it, or Engaged to the institute! While this quip is in reference to the fact that most people wear Brass Rats on their right hand ring finger, participants do not appear to consider the extent of this metaphor. Perhaps it is an acknowledgement that life at MIT is like a rocky marriagethe first part of freshman year is the honeymoon phase, but then students end up living in the academic buildings and sleeping on couches, raising stress levels, and investing large sums of money to make the university happy. Eventually, this engagement will end in a divorce, when these students graduate and move on with their lives as a new batch of hopefuls fill their place. Discussion and ConclusionsThrough this study, we have discovered that MIT students are proud of their quest to survive their undergraduate career, and this pride manifests itself in the form of strange photographs upon receiving a status symbol of attending the aforementioned institution. While strange to an outsider, these photographs appear annually on MIT students social media websites around the last week of April. This tradition will most likely continue as long as Brass Rats are being distributed at a Ring Delivery, which, in all predictions, may be many centuries to come. On a separate (totally not giving you whiplash) note, the day immediately following Ring Delivery was the first chance for the fencing sophomores to show off their new rings at a different formal-ish event, the end of the year fencing banquet. To my knowledge, a lot of sports teams have some form of our-seasons-over-but-we-should-eat-food-or-something-because-you-guys-are-cool type event, and this is the fencing teams version. There is food, merriment, gifts for graduating seniors, special award nominations (for example, the Anne Zabladoff Award for Fencing Masochism or most Clueless Sophomore), and paper plate awards for everyone involved with the team. I dont have any particularly snarky commentary re: photos taken at this event, so here are a couple courtesy of Sherry R. 15. Theres a group photo of the entire team + coaches, the (almost entire) foil squad, 5/6 of womens foil (self-proclaimed highest attendance, lowest attention span), and mens foil making fun of womens foil (plus a rogue mens sabre).         As exams become more and more of a reality that I can't ignore, I find my weekly/fortnightly blogs slowly phasing themselves out. As such I thought I'd steal a simple format from the wonderful NPR podcast Pop Culture Happy Hour and just tell you guys a few things that made me happy this week. The rules are simple, what I post needs to be something that you can also enjoy (called the Zaxxon Rule) and the post shan't be too long.  I was lucky enough to see this movie on April 12th(I realize this was a few weeks ago but it's still making me happy), thanks to the early UK release date, and I absolutely loved it. A huge fan of the original three movies (yes, even the third one)  Spider-Man 2 was always one of my favorite movies and this movie knocked it of its throne. While I still feel like Tobey Maguire plays the better Peter Parker, Andrew Garfield has Spider-Man on lock.  A few weeks back my future boss sent me a few books to check out before I started my internship. Sceptical about the title for this one I put off reading it and spent my free time catching up on a few fantasy books. After finishing The Wise Man's Fear I decided to pick it up and enjoy the beautiful Spring weather. What I found was a wonderful book filled with useful tips and dozens of anecdotes of when these simple steps made a big difference in how a few greats, such as Lincoln, Roosevelt and Andrew Carnegie, ran the country and their businesses. This is a must read for anyone who going into an internship this summer.  When Ernesto '15 and I visited Amsterdam a few weeks back one of our stops was at the de Appel Arts Centre where we found a wonderful exhibition about the artist Nina Yuen. I can't put my finger on what it is about the videos but we sat there and patiently watched all 40+ minutes in a trance. The video above, Heather Who, was my favorite of the bunch.  Sarah Kay is without a doubt one of my favorite spoken word poets and her new poem Ghost Ship is a great example why.   And with that I'll finish with asking you guys a simple question, what's making you happy this week? The college admissions process is often compared to dating. It's a dance that happens between students and colleges where the power dynamic shifts back and forth several times; one courts the other, then the other courts the first, and so on. We spend time and money trying to identify the right students who could be great candidates for our institutions, and do all kinds of outreach--traveling the country, visiting high schools, giving presentations, campus tours, sending brochures and emails...all in hopes that they'll apply to our school. We wait in anticipation to see the applications roll in. Students enter into the application process, picking and choosing which colleges they want to apply to. For those whom we are lucky enough to receive their applications, we read them, learn about their lives, fall in love with many, but can only choose a few. Applicants wait with bated breath to hear back, nervous and anxious, constantly hitting refresh to find out their decision. The tables turn again--once we've admitted a class of students, we begin to court them once more. Shiny tubes, greeting cards, and a four-day extravaganza called Campus Preview Weekend. Now it's our turn to wait, excited and eager, hoping the applicants we love so much will say "yes" in return. And that brings us to today. Many have said yes; welcome to the family! Some have said no; we'll eat a couple pints of ice cream, and all will be okay. But then there are others who haven't said anything yet... If you were admitted to a college, I'm sure you can remember what it was like, constantly hitting refresh, and waiting in anticipation to hear responses from the college(s) you applied to. For the last several weeks, we've now been doing the same. Every day, hitting refresh, waiting to hear back from the 1,419 students we extended admission offers to. (If you think waiting for a handful of college decisions is stressful, try waiting for 1,419 replies.) The deadline has come and gone, and for those of you who haven't responded yet (who haven't been granted extensions for financial aid reasons), I'm guessing most of you have decided to go to another place. That's perfectly fine--we completely understand. There are tons of amazing schools out there, and we know you've made a choice that is right for you. The only thing we ask in return, is that you please let us know. Log in to your MyMIT account, and click on "How to accept or decline our offer of admission", and complete the form. I know breaking up is hard to do, but not knowing is even worse. Plus, it doesn't have to be goodbye forever--we can still be friends...and there's always grad school. :) Thanks for dancing with us, and we look forward to hearing from you soon. P.S. This applies to pretty much every college out there, so if you have other schools you haven't responded to yet, do that too! P.P.S. For those on the waitlist, we haven't forgotten about you either! As you can see above, we empathize with the pain of waiting and not knowing, and want to get back to you as quickly as possible. More news to come soon, I promise.  It's May 1st. Most of your friends have decided where they are going to college in the fall and can sleep soundly.  But making a choice is a little harder for your situation. You may be overwhelmed thinking about prices, distance from home, community, and/or ability to perform well at MIT.      First of all, please     and let's review a few common questions you may have about enrolling at MIT.   1. Are there normal people there?/Are 'my kind of people' at MIT? With 457 different student groups, different dorm personalities and the insane amount of activities happening regularly, the short answer is yes. If you don't want to take my word for it, comment with your must-have interest and I'll look into it.   (This is an activities bulletin board outside my office).   2. I don't think I can handle the curriculum at MIT. Don't let imposter syndome win! We accepted you because we know that you can have a successful MIT career. Here are some wise words from Mikey, our director of selection, who has experienced the same doubts. If you're still worried, there are services available to help you succeed and you'll have a faculty or staff advisor who can help guide you during your four years at the 'tute.   3. I don't think my parents and I can afford MIT. We know that the cost of MIT factors into most students decision processes. Members of the Student Financial Services staff are available to you to answer any remaining questions that might be lingering for you or your family.   Remember that the value of MIT is worth more than the price of the education. Youll be a part of a unique community of problem-solvers receiving a hands-on education that provides opportunities for undergrad research, internship opportunities, and study abroad experiences. ^_^    4. How do I enroll? Log in to your myMIT account and select "I will enroll at MIT for the term beginning September, 2014.*" (There are other options, but you're on your own there.) That's it! No deposit required.  If you think about these questions and decide MIT is not the place for you, we thank you for letting us get to know you this year and wish you the best...    Are there other questions you have about enrolling? I'll be around answering them until 11:59 PM EST tonight to help you make your decision!  In just four short weeks, my time as a MIT freshman will draw to a close. Boxes will be packed, old psets that I will probably never look at again will be thrown away, and students will be scattering across the world for the three months we call summer break. Ive had the opportunity to try so many new and wildly amazing experiences here, some of which Ive recorded in the semi-permanent realm of the blogosphere (who are we kidding, the internet is forever), and I look forward to the ones Ill have in the future. Finals week will mark the end of an era and slowly, one by one, people will leave for internships, MISTI, vacations, or whatever else piques their interest. But its not really goodbye. After all, we have the consolation of knowing that come fall semester, we will all be returning to the familiar rhythm of psets, friends, and free food. Of course, the nature of college renders that last statement faulty in one regard: not all of us will be returning. The new semester marks not only the exciting arrival of the class of 2018, but also the bittersweet departure of the class of 2014. On one hand, we are proud of their accomplishments and wish them only the best in whatever future lies before them. On the other hand, there will always be a whatever-shape-awesome-people-are shaped hole in all of our hearts. Friday was the varsity tennis teams last home game of the year and, consequently, Senior Day, a day to celebrate the seniors and all that theyve accomplished. This year we had two graduating seniors, Lauren and Julia, and we were determined to make it one of the greatest senior days ever. Here is a recipe that I have recorded for posterity: Ingredients: 1 tray of brownie-cookie-dough-Oreo hybrid dessert2 meticulously designed photo collages (Alana 16 is a wizard at making collages)1 pack of goofy 2014 glittery new years paper glasses, courtesy of the internet2 colorful posters for maximum cheering1 heartfelt coaches speech1 instrumental version of Bruno Mars Treasure to sing along with Directions: Prepare the ingredients in the secrecy of someones dorm room, preferably in the company of your fellow teammates. Secretly eat some of the Oreos before they get baked. Begin senior day with heartfelt speeches and gifts from the coaches, followed by a presentation of the team gifts. Ensure that everyone is wearing their goofy glasses and end the mini ceremony with an impeccable (coughcough) group rendition of Treasure, complete with (questionable) choreography and rhythmic mumbling when the revised lyrics are forgotten. Win the match and celebrate the final home game of the season. Makes 1 serving. I started playing tennis when I was 8 years old at my local community park, the majority of my time on the court spent running around in circles and laughing with my friends. At the time, the mechanics of the sport were second in importance to the excitement of the games and youthful camaraderie. As I got older, practices became focused and I began to compete in individual tournaments. I made some amazing friends while travelling to national tournaments around the country, but tennis became more and more of an individual sport and the hours spent running around in circles with friends turned into hours of drills, conditioning, and matches. I loved playing tennis though, so I never really noticed the solitude of an individual sport until high school when I joined the tennis team and rediscovered the same camaraderie that I had had when I was 8. At MIT, as a part of the varsity tennis team, Im happy to say that Ive found the same thing here: a second family. Everyone brings something unique and amazing to the team and I cant imagine it being any other way. Of course, this solidarity is partly an inevitable byproduct of the amount of time that we spend together each week on and off the court.  The team huddles together to celebrate the last home match of the season. I think there might also be a sandwich on the ground. I'm not sure. Like many other fall sports, we started pre-season practice a week before classes started, breaking in new tennis balls while freshman orientation was in full swing. Practice is a daily affair from 5:15-7pm and we have matches virtually every weekend, some at home and a rare few a couple of hours away by bus. Only weeks ago, during our spring season, we played a match at Vassar College in New York and spent the four hour bus ride back playing road trip games and trying not to lose our sanity (though we did discover an appalling lack of desserts that start with the letter E). There is certainly a substantial time commitment that comes with being a student-athlete, one that becomes particularly noticeable when you find yourself staring at the fascinating patterns on the back of the bus seats instead of attending one of the countless events that usually take place on a fine Saturday night. But thankfully, my professors and TAs have been very understanding whenever I have had to skip class for tennis so the only problem I face is finding the time to catch up on the material I have missed. Being a part of the team has solidified my belief that while some things can be done alone, it doesnt mean they have to be; having your friends and team mates around to support you makes things infinitely better. Its like the difference between eating a piece of bread and eating a piece of bread with peanut butter, Nutella, and bananas cheering you on. Unless youre allergic to peanut butter, in which case that was probably a really bad analogy. Our season wraps up with NCAA regionals next weekend and while Friday was the last home match, next weekend could be our last match of the school year. Well be saying goodbye to daily practices, to bumpy bus rides, and to blurry pictures of my friends lecture notes from the classes Ive missed. Most importantly, well be saying goodbye to the seniors. I know Ive only gotten to know them for a year, but its been such a year of unforgettable moments. Next year Ill be a sophomore and the cycle will begin again: new faces, new friends, new family, and the fond memory of all the seniors that have come before. Thankfully, underneath all this change, the joy of the sport and the friendships formed will always be constant. Ive been playing tennis for eleven years now and I dont plan on stopping any time soon. In the future, if you ever see an eighty year old lady running around in circles on a tennis court and laughing with other similarly aged yet surprisingly spry senior citizens, its probably me, rediscovering the same happiness that I had when I was 8 and that I have right now.  You: Where are you from?Me: London.You: But you...you don't...you don't seem to have a British accent.Me: Correct. Let me explain! I was born in Singapore, had a Singaporean accent, then moved to London during the summer before fifth... read more  see complete archives  Books wrote our life story, and as they accumulated on our shelves (and on our windowsills, and underneath our sofa, and on top of our refrigerator), they became chapters in it themselves. How could it be otherwise?     -Anne Fadiman, in the preface to her essay collection Ex Libris * * * There are 37 days before graduation, so I decided that Room Cleaning must begin. I started with my bookshelf, since that seems to be where clutter ultimately accumulates. I unfolded a cardboard box, switched on my desk lamp, and sat down cross-legged on the carpet. I pulled out loose papers. What if I need those vector calculus equation sheets in six years?! Anna, you have them now and you still look everything up on Google. Recycling bin. What if, in ten years, getting a job hinges on having my notes from organic chemistry lecture freshman spring?!? Um, right. Recycling bin.  At some point, I took a break to refill my mug, pausing on my way out the door to switch off the desk lamp. One night during the summer before tenth grade, I put a similar lamp and mug on the floor of a dorm room closet at Franklin & Marshall College. I dutifully turned off the room lights (my summer camp had a strict lights-out policy) then crawled into the closet, pulled the doors shut behind me, and read the newly-released Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows from cover-to-cover while crouching underneath my t-shirts. When I shut the book, I cried. That series had been a steady companion. * * * First into the cardboard box were the books I forgot I owned, followed by the books I had no intention of revisiting. Three categories of books survived the cull: used  but still useful  textbooks, books I havent yet read but am eager to read, and books I regard as old friends. The first category includes Shankar's Principles of Quantum Mechanics and the second includes Le Morte dArthur and The Silmarillion by J.R.R. Tolkien (I owe Prof. Bahr for much of my current reading list.) The third category fills a half-shelf that I would gladly haul across the globe. On the far left is Platos Gorgias. There is a convoluted flowchart opposite the inside cover, in some previous iteration of my handwriting. Callicles points to pleasure and Socrates points to "happiness." Pleasure and happiness are boxed and connected, and labeled Callicles mistakenly assumes that they are the same. There is an arrow from happiness to orderliness, and another from orderliness to cosmic order. On the top of page 105 I wrote what is the ultimate goal of the good life? and on the very last page I underlined to such a degree of lack of education have we come! I read Gorgias in 11th grade, in a semester elective called Early Classical Thought. Mr. Potchatek stood at the window gazing at passers-by while we students sat around an oval table and grappled valiantly with the following question: what the heck is Socrates talking about? I could tell that Mr. Potchatek was listening intently because every now and then our conversation made him smile or frown, and occasionally he wandered over to pose new questions that stunned us all into silence. He never answered his own questions; he let us sit in silence until one of us answered. One day, at the end of class, he told me that the text was still confusing him. He handed me a board marker and asked for my help. I got up at the board while he sat on the table, and together we drew a flowchart that I very happily copied into my copy of Gorgias. Sometimes, when the psets are getting me down and I need a boost, I peek at that flow chart and remember how that moment felt. * * * In July, my annotated Gorgias will travel with me to Marburg, Germany, for an intensive German language course. Then well head south to Heidelberg, and Gorgias will live in my new apartment for a year while I commute to and from the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy. My research question is how did the Milky Way form? and my approach will be to measure and calculate the ages of stars and watch the process unfold. I decided to try out astronomy research during my sophomore year at MIT, partly because I was captivated by a book called First Light. First Light resides two books away from Gorgias, separated by The Language of God by Francis Collins (a gift from a friend as part of our ongoing discussion about whether religion can be reconciled with science) and The Invention of Love by Tom Stoppard (which I read in Prof. Diana Hendersons wonderful Studies in Drama course at MIT). First Light was written by Richard Preston, a science writer who spent many months with a group of astronomers, like (in his own words) Jane Goodall among the chimpanzees. The book is an intimate portrait of obsession: of the kind of person who can be an astronomer, of marching to the slow pace of scientific progress, of the persistence required for discovery. Exaclty how this came to pass is a long story and I'll skip it here, but Preston autographed and mailed me this copy of the book, writing: For Anna Ho, Good luck in all your adventures  keep looking up.  One of the main characters in First Light is Jim Gunn. Preston describes him as a professor at Princeton University overflowing with awards and prizes, but most comfortable in a brown sweater drilled with moth holes and glasses padded around the nose with a wad of electrical tape. I met Jim Gunn a little over a month ago. Actually, its probably more accurate to say that I hunted Jim Gunn down, a little more than a month ago. I was on a graduate school visit and asked Prof. Jill Knapp (his wife) where he was. She led me down to the basement, explaining that he hides behind the vacuum tube. Knock, knock. Jim? Jim Gunn peeked out from behind the metal monstrosity. This is Anna Ho. Shes on a graduate school visit and wants to meet you. And just like that, I was sitting with Jim Gunn behind an enormous vacuum tube. I asked what it was used for, and he said that its not used for anything and its just too big to get out of the room. We spent the next twenty minutes chatting about First Light, what good science writing is, our favorite science fiction authors, and the importance of having breadth as a scientist. Finally, I asked him for his signature and now best of everything! Jim Gunn is taped next to Prestons note.  * * * Much of First Light takes place at Caltechs Palomar Observatory, so there will be something deeply romantic and satisfying about taking the book with me when I move from Heidelberg to Pasadena in order to begin pursuing my astronomy PhD at Caltech. When I'm banging my head against the wall fitting datasets or writing telescope proposals, Preston and Gunn will remind me of the big picture.  I love astronomy and doing astronomy research, but Im a little nervous about becoming a graduate student. In his book Awakenings, the neurologist Oliver Sacks describes the feeling as follows: we are over-developed in mechanical competence, but lacking in biological intelligence, intuition, awareness; and it is this, above all, that we need to regain, not only in medicine, but in all science. For Sacks, a doctor, the point is that treating" or "curing" a human being is a lot more than wielding a syringe. It can and should involve compassionate listening and emotional support. We risk forgetting that as we become more technologically advanced. Im not a doctor and my science is less obviously related to human beings, but as an undergraduate I've happily engaged with people through teaching and public outreach, and enjoyed pursuing a variety of interests through classes. At MIT, surrounded by the very highest mechanical competence, I feel like I was rescued by my humanities classes and my various extracurricular activities: I became a much better teacher and writer and speaker, and learned about cultures and civilizations in addition to scientific ideas and numerical techniques. All that said, Ive been told that the goal of graduate school is to focus and Im not sure how to best stay in touch with other interests and values.  Awakenings reminds me of all of this, so it sits on my bookshelf, leaning on First Light. * * * I spent the first semester of senior year frantically trying to make plans for the future: interviews, phone calls, essays, applications, letters of recommendation, presentations. This semester, those plans are set and my task is to transition out of here. The hardest part is deciding what should come with me and what should stay behind. It took me two hours spread over three days to trim down my bookshelf, and I'm still not feeling comfortable about all those old psets... Next up are my clothes. I just took out a new cardboard box, and tossed in a pair of sweatpants that I want to donate. While I work on that, go take a look at your bookshelf (if you haven't already) and tell me (I'm curious): which books have kept you company for a long time? It's that time of year again - SpringFest!  This past weekend was filled with fun events like the McCormick Hall picnic and lots of energy saving activities.  But my personal favorite event was SpringFest's annual concert, featuring Capital Cities and Flosstradamus! The opening act was Scavenger Hunt, and they were really awesome! I got to test out my new camera during their set, and I am pretty happy with the results.      After the first three songs, I had some down time to go around and see some friends!  There were about 9 EMTs roaming around that I got to hang out with, as well as some friends from East Campus!   Then it was time for Capital Cities!  They were fantastic - the trumpet solos especially were incredible!        And then the final act - Flosstradamus! They definitely got the crowd moving and jumping all around.   Overall, the concert was great, the set-up was beautiful, and SpringFest was a success :)  Last night, MIT sophomores dressed in black-tie attire flocked to the beautiful State Room in Boston to receive their glorious Brass Rats! Michael C. '16 explained in his post about Ring Premiere what the design of our ring looks like, but as of last night we now have our own beautiful rings to show to the world on our beautiful 2016 hands! LOOK AT MY PRETTY RING!  It feels so good! I have many pictures from and of the event, mostly of my fellow Tetazoa and other East Campusers, but some with and of friends in my class that I was really excited to see! We had a great time, and afterwards a bunch of us went to Bova's Bakery to get Cannoli's together! Here are some pictures of the event and of my beautiful friends!    We even got to take a series of prom pictures!      We also took more prom pictures once we got to the event!    It definitely felt like prom - the view from the State room was absolutely gorgeous!  We got some really nice shots in front of the beautiful view.   And here is Nico F. '16, one of the members of RingComm, the committee that plans ring delivery and designed our beautiful ring!  AND THEN I FOUND HARRY B. '16!! Yay Harry! He's so Canadian!   Of course I needed a picture with Harry! Thanks to Will R. '16 for taking this picture! Here is Will:  I also got a picture with Jake I. '16! We took a "selfie."  And Random Hall showed up to the event in full black-tie attire :)  There was a beautiful ice sculpture in the shape of a ring! Sadly, the sculpture mysteriously disapeared a while into the event.  THE VENUE WAS SO PRETTY AND CLASSY!    THAT VIEW!  And there were so many photographers! Eurah K. '16 and I took pictures with our fancy cameras.  We also had a mini Intel STS '12 reunion! We couldn't find Adam K. '16, sadly, but we did have Ani P. '16, Jin P. '16, Jordan C. '16 and me!  And I found some of my course 3 friends! Here are Isabel C. '16 and I with our new Brass Rats! Photo taken by Nick M. '16:  And here are Nick and Isabel looking pretty!  Tetazoo arrived at Ring Delivery initially with Beast, the second floor of the east parallel (we are the third floor, known as the third east traveling animal zoo).  However, as the night progressed, we found ourselves additionally hanging out with Florey, the fifth floor. Usually we have a small rivalry with that floor, but last night we put our differences aside in order to potentially accomplish greater things.    After ring delivery, a bunch of us went to Bova's to get cannoli's!  So overall, the event was a huge success! We had a bunch of fun dressing up, goofing off, and just hanging out together as a class.   And finally, as always, I will end this post with pictures of cats! Today is Galileo and Thor's third birthday!!! They got wet food as a birthday present from their wonderful owner, Kerry N. '14.    If you're a regular on /r/technology, you might have seen Project Naptha trending the front page. I've blogged a couple of times already about hackathons at MIT and how amazing they are in the amount of experience, learning, and motivation they can give you in the space of ten or twenty sleepless hours. Project Naptha, created by my classmate Kevin K. '17, is a Chrome extension whose birth I witnessed (and blogged about) at HackMIT last October. Then called "ImagesAsText," he took home second prize (and $2000) for his work. What, exactly, does Project Naptha do? From the website: You can see it in action on the Project Naptha website. It's pretty amazing. Essentially, it detects text from memes, image macros, screenshots, graphs, scanned images, and even certain photographs (yes, that includes rotated text) and treats it as highlightable text. Then, using some nifty image processing, it allows you to remove that text from the image entirely, or replace it with its translation in a different language, or replace it with whatever text you desire. There's even an Easter egg that gives the selected text an animation. It does all of this image processing in real time, with no discernible lag or delay. It can do this for pretty much every language on the Internet, including non-latinate languages like Chinese and Russian. Kevin is kind of a hacker extraordinaire. Project Naptha has since been picked up by PCWorld, the Verge, Engadget, and CNET. CNET calls it "nothing short of JavaScript black magic." Since its release yesterday, it has had upward of 52,000 downloads (as of 5:09 PM EDT on April 25).  It's not perfect, but it comes very, very close, really limited only by the technologies of optical character recognition, translation quality, and the image processing that fills in the image where text is removed (think Photoshop's Content Aware Fill). The only question really left is--can it do Captchas? Signing off, Allan Add Project Naptha to Chrome here. For demos and backstory, check out the website. You: Where are you from?Me: London.You: But you...you don't...you don't seem to have a British accent.Me: Correct. Let me explain! I was born in Singapore, had a Singaporean accent, then moved to London during the summer before fifth... read more  see complete archives  My name is Anna Ho, and I am a student at  No, no. Thats not the point. My name is Anna Ho, and I am a constituent living in Cambridge. I am a student at MIT majoring in physics. Ugh, I sound like a robot. Sound cheerful! BE cheerful! ITS SO EXCITING TO BE HERE! Hi! Thank you so much for taking the time to meet with us. My name is Anna Ho, and Im a constituent living in Cambridge. Im a senior at MIT majoring in physics, but today Im here representing the American Astronomical Society. ...and Im very nervous, because Im an idealistic 21-year-old who would really like to think that its better to Engage than it is to Criticise From Afar, and somehow I find myself here in DC to meet with my representatives. Ive heard that people charge into policy work feeling like theyre going to change the world, and soon become disenchanted and frustrated. And Im afraid that on Wednesday, I will find out that all of these meetings with my representatives are just formalities to win my vote. * * * Our training begins on Monday March 24. Around ten of us have arrived in DC already, and we start by going around the room and introducing ourselves. The guy to my left works at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Maryland, building cameras for telescopes. The woman to my right does research on the sun at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. Theres a professor from Northwestern somewhere behind me. There are a handful of graduate students, and Im the token undergraduate. The first speaker is Josh Shiode. Josh has a PhD in astronomy from UC Berkeley and is now a John Bahcall Public Policy Fellow at the American Astronomical Society (AAS). Translation: he brought his scientific training and communication talents with him to the policy world of Washington D.C. He communicates in two directions: he advocates on behalf of the astronomy community to policymakers, and keeps the astronomy community informed about important changes in policy. This week, his job is to prepare a delegation of 15 AAS members to lobby on Capitol Hill. This Monday afternoon, his talk is called Congress in Context. I frantically take notes, trying to go from Zero Knowledge to Enough Knowledge. Congress in Context: Josh walks us through how a bill becomes a law (the takeaway: very few do) and introduces us to important vocabulary. The deficit, for example. Non-defense discretionary spending (our stuff!) and the nature of its shrinking. The Budget Control Act, the Bipartisan Budget Act, high spending on mandatory programs, the difference between authorizations and appropriations (the theory and the reality), examples of authorizing committees, examples of appropriating committees. Current status: the Presidents Budget Request  which proposes spending levels for each agency  is out. Now, Congress is working on actually allocating funding (appropriations), in theory within the authorized bounds. There are many organizations lobbying on Capitol Hill for a piece of nondefense discretionary pie, and we are one of them. No pressure. After a short coffee break (astronomers have caffeine running through their veins) we reconvene for a talk by Anna Quider, who works at the US State Department. Anna is another PhD astronomer who decided to dedicate her life to policy, and her job this afternoon is to introduce us to our audience. Our audience is: Congressional Staff. Before you walk into the House or the Senate, she says, you need to understand who these people are. Each Member of Congress has a group of Congressional Staff (staffers) who distill and relay information to the congressman about particular issues, to help him or her cast an informed vote. This sounds like an enormous responsibility, so I am astonished to learn that some staffers are not a whole lot older than I am. For many staffers, Anna tells us, this is their FIRST JOB EVER. Theyre smart 20- or 30-something year olds, expected to become experts in a wide variety of areas often outside their educational background. When Anna was a staffer, her portfolio included education, small business and entrepreneurship, national security, innovation, and all of science and technology. When the staffer in charge of healthcare issues left, Anna was given that job, and told: well, science is the next closest thing.  To help staffers, there is a non-partisan knowledge tank on Capitol Hill called the Congressional Research Service. But even with this resource, consider what the job entails: teaching yourself about a vast range of complicated and important issues that you have limited (or no) academic experience with, picking out the salient points, then relaying information up the chain to a Member of Congress. With this in mind, Anna shows us a typical staffer schedule: it is packed from 8am until 9pm, with no obvious breaks.  The fact that [the staffer you contacted] took your meeting request is a small miracle, Anna said. You have a foot in the door. These are a PRECIOUS TWENTY MINUTES. She mentions that our 30-minute scheduled meeting might end up lasting two minutes and be held standing in a hallway, or even turn out to include a bunch of other scientists from other organizations. Thanks to Anna, I have a mental image of the very hard-working but very busy person I will be meeting with on Wednesday. Obviously, I cant waste this persons time. What is special about me? What information can I uniquely deliver? * * * The last session on Monday is led by Jen Greenamoyer, a Senior Government Relations Liaison at the American Institute of Physics. With her, we will finally begin to hammer out what exactly to say during our meetings. The talk is titled: Delivering Your Message on Capitol Hill and I take away five key points: Heads swimming, we break into groups for a roleplay activity. I become Jason Ellis, lobbyist for an organization called Save Our Coastal Resources. The Space Telescope Science Institute astronomer to my left becomes congresswoman Katherine Greer, a Republican from Oregon who is currently undecided about how to vote on a bill. The Harvard-Smithsonian astronomer to my right becomes Allison Lowder, a lobbyist for the U.S. Shrimpers Association. We each have something like 5 minutes to skim a briefing on the bill, then hold a meeting with the congresswoman trying to persuade her to vote one way or the other. Allison Lowder holds her meeting while I run out to the bathroom, and I come back pumped to argue on behalf of SOCR. The Sawfish will become extinct if no steps are taken to protect it, I say. All life on our planet is connected and dependent on each other, and there is serious threat to this species... At the end, I feel pretty good about my spiel. But Congresswoman Lowder votes no, and Allison Lowder cheers. What did I do wrong?! As we switch groups, Congresswoman Katherine Greer turns to me and says: you know why I voted no? Grumpily, I ask why. Because she he points to Lowder  went first. That night, in front of the mirror: My name is Anna Ho, and Im a constituent living in Cambridge. Im a senior at MIT majoring in physics, but today Im here representing the American Astronomical Society. In the fall, Im going to start a PhD program in astronomy.  Here is my contact information. If I can be a resource for you, please dont hesitate to contact me.  * * * On Monday, the talks were about science advocacy in general; today, the focus is on astronomy. Its Tuesday, all fifteen of us are finally here, and were sitting in a conference room at American Astronomical Society headquarters. At 9am, the Executive Officer gives us a warm welcome before leaving to go sign checks or something (he makes us laugh at 9am, which is no mean feat). For the next three hours, the AAS Director of Public Policy joins forces with Josh to bring us up to speed. They review terminology from yesterday, this time highlighting particular authorization bills that directly affect our field. They fill us in on current astronomy policy issues, most of which involve the National Science Foundation. Themes from yesterday resurface: your primary currency is your credibility, if you prove to be a useful resource people will come back to you, your face and your personal story alone are worth the visit. I take notes as usual but am a little distracted by the thought that woah, the AAS Director of Public Policy is sitting next to me. I snap out of my reverie when someone down the table asks what to do if were asked about the NSF Portfolio Review. Asked about the what?! The response is that if we get asked about the NSF Portfolio Review, we are to go out and have a beer to celebrate that someone up on Capitol Hill actually knows what the NSF is. If we get tough but informed questions, thats a reason to celebrate. At this point, the Associate Vice President for Research at the University of Alabama in Huntsville chimes in to remind us that our job is to promote our field, not to bash other fields or other organizations. I dont think it ever benefits anybody, he says, to speak from the perspective of negativity. Much more effective to present a united front, instead of bickering amongst ourselves while the politicians go deal with other issues. After lunch, we travel to the headquarters of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS). We sit through a series of talks. The highlight is a Q&A with staffers: Sean Gallagher from Congressman Rush Holts office is particularly enthusiastic and articulate. Were a filter for our boss, he tells us, but we tend to be a mile wide and an inch deep. You are our educators. Takeaways include: Suddenly, I realize what information I can uniquely provide during my meetings. I pull out my notebook to scribble down the first draft of my message. * * * Its Tuesday night and Im lying on my stomach in my hotel room bed. Tomorrow morning, I will lead meetings with staffers from two Massachusetts offices: Representative Michael Capuanos office and Senator Ed Markeys office. Im frantically reviewing. Michael Capuano. Very passionate about higher education. Makes sense, considering that the 7th congressional district has over a dozen research institutes, universities (including MIT and Harvard) and teaching hospitals. 1/5 of Nobel Prize winners have lived, studied, or worked in this district. Capuano has a lot to be proud of. Capuanos staffer: Andrew Eaton. BA in Political Science from U. Conn. Portfolio includes: budget, tax, social security, education, science, welfare, US Postal Service. Ed Markey. Already supportive of expanding investment in science research programs. This meeting can probably be short. Markeys staffer: Dan Pomeroy. PhD in High Energy Experimental Physics, has worked at the Large Hadron Collider. This meeting can definitely be short. My name is Anna Ho, and Im a constituent living in Cambridge. Im a senior at MIT majoring in physics, but today Im here representing the American Astronomical Society. In the fall, Im going to start a PhD program in astronomy, but when I started college I didnt think that I was cut out to be a research scientist. The summer after my sophomore year, I did an internship funded by the National Science Foundation. I loved it so much that I went back the next summer and did it again. I learned that I wanted to do research because I had the opportunity to try doing research. And I had that opportunity because of this program. I became a scientist because of this program.  I set my alarm for 6am and dream about sleeping through meetings. - Part 2 to follow -   Im fast asleep, probably snoring lightly and elegantly. My bodys shut down. Why, you ask? Why, you really ask? Why not? Ive just had all my rights violated by the Massassassachisetts Institvte of Technology and the Arts, passing through a 3-midterm, 1-pset, 1-mini-paper week. Its finally the weekenda four-day weekend at thatbut MIT has another thing coming if it thinks giving me four days off will be sufficient bribe to calm my fiery sense of injustice.  So Im probably just having some meandering, semi-psychopathic dream that will no doubt trudge its way into the dreary stew of words Ill call a story when my alarm goes off. The stupid thing begins blaring and blaring and oh please shut up! Anyway, I manage to rise and after mumbling a couple of sleepy words no doubt filled with infinite wisdom, I realize that its nearly five p.m.  I mumble an expletive I cant use on this blog, because cats read it or something and they lose a life for each such word. Im supposed to meet up with my advisor. Its Saturday, and he has a nice outing planned. Its one of those things where MIT tries to compensate for beating the crap out of everyone by offering nice dinners, and I was actually looking forward to eating something that couldnt crawl out of my plate or didnt seem to be having heart palpitations (yes, this is a not-even-slightly-veiled reference to the varied assortments of muck and dredge Maseeh Dining serves). Cue to me walking down Mass Ave, where Bostons accursed weather is actually kind of nice for once. Maybe too nice. Im suspicious, but I can wear a T-Shirt and thats fine. Im supposed to meet up my advisor, Saif Rayyan, in his car, with his wife and some of my classmates from Concourse. After a few minutes of texting and jaywalking and all manner of things that form the basis of Youtube ads, I finally lumber past the lumbering Stata Center (and can we please just talk about Stata! Its like concrete someone chewed, swallowed and regurgitated. What gives?!). And there he is! I tumble into the backseat of his car, where my friend and classmate Ava waves ever so nicely at me. You rock, Ava. Saifs wife is in the front seat beside him. Next comes the question of where to eat. My brain is still mostly fried from sleep so I suggest somewhere in MIT. We also debate other places, like Legal Seafood, which is just a fancy place you willingly let steal your money. But when my advisor calls, we find that its been fully booked, and that the restaurant is unable to steal from us at this time. Thus, we head to Woodys instead, a nice, picturesque (yes, that is a pretentious word, stop judging me!) restaurant a walk away from the Boston University Theatre, where my advisor has bought play tickets for us. But to get to Woodys, we have to go through All That Is Wrong With Earth And Life that is the Boston traffic. This at least allows for decent chatter, where we talk about exams and home and the meaning of life. In Woodys, we need to decide what to eat. After much deliberation, we settle on the sole hallmark and signifier of Americas achievementsthe Pizza. We add all sorts of things to itmushrooms and onions and pineapples and a few things that should be made mandatory at every meal. I show initial concern about how much to get, but my advisor does his marvelous job and advises me to let MIT have it! Its on them after all. And so I descend into a travesty of near-gluttonous abandon, ordering all the things. This evening, crimes against the stomach are at an all time high, starring such villains as***3 20 oz. glasses of orange juice ***six or seven or nine slices of pizza; after a while, you lose track and the world around you just glows with the pepperoni hue of pizza-induced hallucinations ***creme brulee! Because why not? Though it came riddled with a bunch of fruits I could have done without. And before your glaring eyes furl up in mortified consternation and all such politically correct reactions, you should realize that I spent the past several hours, from before eating to the previous evening mostly sleeping, and had pretty much eaten nothing since then. That said, by the time I was done, my stomach had swelled to epic proportions, and I sat there feeling like Id eaten a couple of Santa Clauses. Hee. But mostly eww. But mostly hee. Wut? Anyway, with everyone else done eating as well, we rise as one and head to the Boston University Theatre. The weather is still nice, and nope, Im still not buying it. Somethings up. At the Theatre, we meet one more Concourse student, and Saifs wife retreats somewhere backstage. Shes a classical pianist and will be one of many contributing to the operas beautiful music. The opera by the way is titled Don Giovanni, and after the execrable atrocity that was Paranormal Activity (how did that drivel get so many sequels), Im confident that this will be much better. I struggle through a bunch of people all standing around and talking, and walk into the dimly lit theater where I take my seat. My advisor is two seats away and he seems happy. I remember some stories his wife told us of him falling asleep in some of the past operas and giggle. Hee. Soon enough, the curtains rise and we begin with a dramatic flashing of lights, red and blue and orange against a heavy musical backdrop of swelling piano notes and grand trumpeting. Pretty quickly into the opera, theres a murder. Some random old dude is stabbed. He sings and moans and sings as fake blood squirts out, and I know Im gonna enjoy this. Its a three-hour opera though, three hours, and Ill be honest. I had a few issues with the pacing of the story, but the songs were really enjoyable, the actors extremely talented and a lot of lines pretty funny. Don Giovanni is one heck of a Lady Magnet, maybe too much, and thats pretty adorable. When hes not, you know, running from girl to girl or proposing to a woman with her fiance just barely out of earshot. Hes a jerk, and thats the point. A funny, lovable jerk in his own right, but a jerk nonetheless. And you can tell somethings gonna happen, retribution-wise. Hell get beaten to death or stomped on or stabbed or shot orare you kidding me? Thats how you decide to do it? Large sounds and flames and him falling backwards and a crack of hell and well, okay, this was a fun show so Ill accept. After a pretty enjoyable time, the opera is over, and the curtain falls. We get to clap hard for all the actors and actresses, and I see something pretty interesting. I see Saif, my physics teacher and advisor, cheer for the actors, which is fine, but hes really cheering, with great energy and stuff, along the lines of: Wuuuuuuuu! Yeaaah! Wuuuu! Wuuu! Wuu! Wuuuuuuu! Wuuuuuuuuuuuuu! WUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU! Its really nice to see and Im having laughing fits all over the place, as we leave the Theatre and stumble out into The outside! And aha! I knew there was something most foul (I just watched an opera! I get to say things like most foul) about the weathers niceness. It was a trap. Now, its pretty cold and Im shivering like a Course 18 about to see their HASS grade. (P.S. Ive actually seen a Course 18 see his grade for a HASS class. It would seem they dont shiver so much as bite their lips all serious-like and mumble a good number of Hmms). Saif drives us back to our respective dorms and we bid him adieu. ***So all in all, it was a pretty nice day, and Im willing to concede that MIT does a nice job of trying to connect students and faculty whenever possible. I hear you all screaming cop-out, but Im typing this post on the heels of a fugue-like, barely conscious state (psets, programming, enough error messages from Python to scar me for several lifetimes, dont ask) so Ill just tell you to deal with it. And after things like the evening with my advisor, the doorway to sappy sentimentality opens up. A bunch of thoughts flash through my head. Exams and psets and friends and complaining. And I realize that yup, I absolutely love this place. See you guys on the other side. Other side of what, you ask? Good question.    I've mentioned in prior posts that my hall, Tetazoo, in East Campus is very involved in climbing and hiking and other wonderful adventures.  We traditionally have a camping trip each fall, but this year Kayla E. '15 and Becca G. '14 organized a last minute spring camping trip with 18 people out to Rumney, New Hampshire.  We were all extremely excited for this last minute opportunity to relax and have some fun climbing, hiking, and camping in the wilderness.  We split into four cars with three different agendas: I was a part of Car 3 with Jackie. We were all excited for the adventure, and drove up Sunday night to Rumney, New Hampshire, to camp outside of the MITOC (MIT Outdoors Club) Camelot Cabin.  I actually saw Cathie Y. '16 there on a different MITOC adventure! Once all 18 of us tetazoans (and some friends) set up camp, we gathered around the fire and roasted some marshmallows.  At one point, Cappie P. '13 stood up and informed us that there was a place in the woods nearby called the "Observatory," which was a small clearing of trees and an overturned canoe where you can sit and watch the stars.  Five of us went to follow him on a search for the overturned canoe.  We quickly found ourselves hiking around in circles, stepping on snow and rocks and the tiny river that ran through the lot.  Cappie left with Barbie D. '17 back to camp, and the rest of us went searching for the stars. We eventually found the overturned canoe, and the astrophotographer among us, NiBr '17, took some beautiful pictures of the sky. Finally, we started our hike back to camp.  However, we found ourselves lost in the woods late at night, and couldn't even find the campfire from where we were.  We trekked through the forest, and finally saw some lights - however, they were street lights, not cabin lights. The cabin was a small hike from where we parked our cars on the street, so we headed towards the lights.  Along the way, we found a mobile home, and the widest part of the river we possibly could have found in that area. We hopped along the stones in the rapidly flowing river, and we found our way to the street. We ended up two large lots away from where we had parked our cars, but eventually found our way back to the rest of our group, excited from the adventure we just had. We all woke up early the next morning, ate our bagels that we had brought for the trip, and got on our way to our separate adventures.  My group of Cars 3 and 4 decided to do a small hike with a pretty waterfall, known as Nancy Cascades. It was supposed to be a nice two hour hike, and we figured that we could stop at the top of the waterfalls to eat our lunch and relax for a bit, maybe even take a nap. The ride there was fun. Sadun '17 got on the wheel, and although he frightened us at times, it was a lot of fun and he kept trying to get us to play road games and sings songs about bears and things. We saw all sorts of great things along the way, including cows!   The thing is, we couldn't find the trail head. We had a map, but we didn't purchase the New Hampshire trail book ahead of time because we thought we didn't need it.  So we found a parking lot near the GPS coordinates on the website, and started walking in the direction we figured the trail head probably was.  The place we parked near had a trail head for Davis Path, which I was really excited for, but everyone else wanted to look for waterfalls. I also love waterfalls, so I followed.  Still, we found some nature!  We stopped to ask for directions - twice -  and finally found our way to the trail head!  It was an adventure getting there, that's for sure. It was all in good fun!  At least there was more nature!  Finally, we found a trail head, which supposedly led to the trail we needed to follow to get to Nancy Cascades.  We made our way up a mountain, excited for the adventure. However, in front of us was a trail filled with miles of snow. It made it a bit difficult to get around.    The snow was pretty bad, but we kept pushing forward. Eventually we made it to the actual Nancy Cascades trail, marked by some bloody red paint. We took turns posing with the painted rocks all around us.   And we found more nature!  But with the nature came a whole lot of terrible snow.  It really was quite awful trekking through the snow without snow gear.  There was about a foot-wide path of packed down snow, but if you stepped off the path or slid outside of that area you found yourself waist-deep in cold, wet snow. It was still a really pretty adventure, though.    It took us a lot longer than we thought to get anywhere because of the snow. Almost three hours into the hike, and we were unsure about if we were even halfway to the top! We finally decided to stop by a really pretty area by the river for lunch and to dry our socks and shoes for a bit in the sun. It was really nice out - almost in the 70s - yet we were surrounded by snow!  After our break, we continued on the path, which was a bit more clearly labeled now since it had some steep areas that were really icy, as well as some ledged areas which were a little scary.  Finally, we found a sign! It didn't tell us where we were though or how much further we had to go, but we did feel a bit better that at least we were on the right path.  Eventually, we set a time for ourselves to give up. We left for the hike around 10:30am-ish, and it was closing in on 2pm. After falling into and out of snow and starting to lose the feeling in our toes and legs, three of us decided to stop where we were at 1:50pm and wait there for the group, which would turn around at 2pm anyways. We told them to yell back at us if they find the cascades in the next ten minutes, and we waited.  We waited ten minutes and heard nothing. We waited ten more minutes. After waiting 25 minutes in the snow, we left them a note on tree bark.   As we started walking back, two more of our hiking friends ran to catch up to us.  They had done the same thing as us five minutes out, and had also given up on the three people ahead of us, but told us that they had heard that the three hikers at the head of the trail had finally found the Nancy Cascades! They said that it was beautiful, but not really worth us going back for it because it would take another half hour. So we all turned around, and with me at the head of the group, made our way out of Nancy Cascades, not so excited for the slippery slopes ahead of us.    After our really long, and at times painful, hike, we all got together and rested. I walked back to the car with my bare feet on the hot asphalt of the New Hampshire highway, and we went back to Rumney, New Hampshire, to meet up with the rest of our group. Six of us changed our minds about going hiking during the night, and we shuffled around cars until it worked out.  We warned the other cars about the snowy conditions they will encounter during the night, and headed home a day early. I was really happy to get home. It's nice to be away from the snow and back in my comfy bed.  And, as always, the cats were really happy to have some of us back.    How was your CPW? It was definitely one of my favorites. I had lots of fun meeting a you future froshies in person. Today I wanted to address some concerns about CPW by sharing my own experiences. Recently, I got into Reddit (bad idea at this time of semester), especially r/MIT. One post that hit close to home was titled "Did anyone here not enjoy CPW but still love MIT once they were actually a student?" A prefrosh talked about how he felt he wouldn't fit into the MIT community because, during CPW,  all the events were about "legos" and "foam swords" and other kiddie kid stuff for little kids. He went to the informative events, but found himself one of the few prefrosh there. It was really hard connecting with other prefrosh, as it seemed that they were all on board with doing kiddie things for fun but he didn't share those interests. Even though I personally had lots of fun during my CPW, that same thought always floated around in the back of my head. I felt I wouldn't fit in unless my idea of a fun time was playing Super Smash Bros until 5 am while stuffing my face with mashed potatoes. Like the prefrosh in that thread, I too was one of the few prefrosh to go to the more official and "mature" events. I was worried that people didn't share my interests. But, as it turns out, CPW was more of an indicator of the kinds of things you COULD do with friends if you wanted to, not the things you'd have to participate in if you want to have fun here. When I came to MIT in the fall, I met so many people that destroyed that kiddie stereotype. During CPW, everything was hectic and squeezed into four days. During orientation and rush week, I got to know people from so many backgrounds, all with different ideas for fun. I immediately got involved with my dorm, other student groups, and fraternity life. I met people who liked the things I liked doing, so I felt at home. But I also become friends with people who I would've never imagined being friends with. We try making CPW as best as we can, but nomatter what, it'll always be such a small window to the vastness of the types of people that make up MIT. Besides, if you think that all we do are kiddie things, then you are mistaken, just like I was. We do pretty manly stuff. You know what's really manly? Steak. You know what's even manlier? Steak at 1 am. You know what goes great with steak at 1 am? Milk shakes. Cue Steak and Shake, which was held at Phi Kappa Sigma every CPW night. After a long hard day of having fun, prefrosh came and relaxed, enjoying steak and shake while playing pool and talking to brothers and other prefrosh about anything and everything. On Saturday night, I stayed up with three prefrosh until 5 am, at which point we decided that we might as well continue staying awake to watch the sunrise. It always had such a chill atmosphere, and everyone had a great time.  But I wasn't at Phi Kappa Sigma enjoying the classic atmosphere the entire CPW. I also did nonsensical things with my friends, like watching them cover their faces with sugar by blowing into cups.  There was also a great performance by the MIT improv comedy troupe Roadkill Buffet. Super manly and mature? Maybe not, but who cares? It was funny. Let loose and have fun.  At MIT, no matter what your type is, there's always a group of people who share your interests. Maybe your type is playing with foam swords in a ball pit. Maybe your type is going to a classy business luncheon and networking with econ professors. Maybe your type is playing pool at 1 am with a refreshing milkshake in one hand and a juicy piece of steak in the other. Or maybe your type is doing all three. Whichever way, MIT is a great place where you'll meet some of the coolest people you'll know for the rest of your life. Plus, who wouldn't want to hang out with these AXO girls?

There are literally (literally!) a dozen blog posts I wish I could write for you right now but I cant, at least not for at least another week. I want to talk to you, especially since some of you need to decide whether or not to come to MIT and the rest of you might be bored. This is an open conversation. I will answer any (any!) question you ask as honestly as I would if I were the one asking.  second semester senior at MIT, majoring in computer science and molecular biology (6-7) and math (18) and minoring in writing (21W). This fall I will be starting my MEng in computer science and molecular biology and TAing 6.005 (elements of software construction), my favorite class at MIT (tied with advanced fiction workshop with Junot Diaz). When I grow up I want to write (illustrated) novels and useful (illustrated?) software.

Scrolling through the original message, I saw a comment that "Dudamel is cool." So, even though I had no idea whether Dudamel was a music genre, an instrument, a song title, or a composer, I replied "I'm definitely down! :)" and reserved a ticket. A month later, Google Calendar told me that I should meet Ashley at MIT's Kresge Auditorium. The theater was PACKED (I thought: "wow! this Dudamel thing must be *very* cool!") but we squeezed and "sorry! excuse me!"d our way in. Flipping through my program, I learned very quickly that Dudamel is not a music genre. Dudamel is not an instrument, or a song title, or a composer. Dudamel is, according to the program bio, "Music Director of both the Simon Bolivar Symphony Orchestra of Venezuela and the Los Angeles Philharmonic, and the impact of his musical leadership is felt on four continents." His guest conducting appearances include the NY Philharmonic and the Munich Philharmonic. Feeling very uncultured, I went on to read that he was voted into the Gramophone Hall of Fame, has won a gazillion awards, is in the Royal Swedish Academy of Music, and was one of Time Magazine's 100 most influential people in 2009. Yep. Definitely not a musical instrument. I got a little bored of the laundry list of musical accolades, so it was refreshing - and a little surprising - to read that Harvard recently awarded him the Q Prize "for extraordinary service to children." I was equally surprised to look up and see small children sitting on stage: in the front row, there were 7- and 8-year-olds clutching miniature violins with their feet dangling above the ground. Turns out that the "concert" was actually an open rehearsal, as part of the Sistema Side by Side seminario series. A seminario is a tradition in Venezuela, where Dudamel is from. According to the program, a seminario is "a larger ensemble community." "Children from music programs in various neighborhoods and regions frequently come together...to make music together." This particular seminario was made up of: children from the Los Angeles Philharmonic Youth Orchestra (YOLA) who had flown across the country for this event + children from Massachusetts + conservatory students from the Longy School of Music of Bard College. The MA kids and the Longy students were paired up as part of a community program called Side By Side: they've been rehearsing together every weekend for the past year. They all wore matching black t-shirts that said SIDE BY SIDE in white letters. The timpani pair were particularly adorable; there was a little kid wearing a cast partnered up with a tall young man from Longy, and their height ratio was about 1:2. It was a very strange construction: the intimacy of a children's orchestral rehearsal up on stage in front of a gigantic audience, led by a famous conductor. The audience was packed with parents, sponsors, and random MIT community members who were on some mailing lists and might not have known a whole lot about what they were walking into. The man in front of me spent the entire rehearsal Facetiming on his iPhone with a woman who I presume was the mother of one of the young performers. Imagine what this meant for Dudamel himself: as my friend Davie '12 (who was also at the concert) put it, he had three different - not obviously reconcilable - tasks. He had to, as the conductor, run a functional and productive rehearsal. As a performer (and when a Kresge Auditorium-ful of people are watching you, you are performing whether you like it or not) he had to entertain. As the conductor of a performing children's orchestra, he had to make the children comfortable up there on the stage. Spoiler alert: he did all three, spectacularly. After an introduction that included a thank-you to Rafael Reif for providing space at MIT (WOOOOO! MIT!!!!!) Dudamel finally walked on stage. On his way from stage right to the podium, he shook hands with several of the children and beamed at everybody. When the auditorium fell silent, he asked one of the kid's in the front row: "it's too warm in here! is it okay if I take off my jacket?" I guess the kid gave Dudamel his blessing, because Dudamel took off his fancy jacket to reveal a black t-shirt and jeans. He eased himself onto a wooden stool and leaned his elbows on his knees. And just like that, the entire auditorium relaxed too. My first impression of Dudamel was: "Wow, Dudamel is adorably awkward." He stumbled over his words, mumbling that he didn't really know the music that well, actually he didn't know the music at all, and what were we even here to play again? Some little kid told him the answer. "Oh, okay," he said. "You guys will have to lead me, because I don't know the music." Ha! The orchestra were playing the Farandole from Bizet's L'Arlesienne Suite No. 2 and the Finale from Tchaikovsky's Symphony No. 5 in E Minor, and so of course Dudamel had both of those pieces totally committed to memory (not to mention he was 110% prepared for the rehearsal). But it was a trick to make the kids more comfortable with him, and it was endearing. He reminded me of Papageno, for those of you familiar with Mozart's Magic Flute -- he adopted a kind of charming woodland creature quality, perching on the edge of that stool. He occasionally shifted to look over his shoulder and quip to the audience. And then he lifted up his baton, and I realized that Dudamel isn't awkward at all; he's just expertly theatrical. Before long, he had left his stool and was standing up and Papageno was out of my mind; instead, I thought that Dudamel could be a dancer, the way he stood up straight and seemed to have complete control of every single movement. He also had the BEST similes. "These two phrases," he would say. "They are the same on paper, no? They are like twins. But twins - you are still different, a little bit. So we must play them differently." To describe a grand passage, a dancer's thumping long legs. To describe a passage of rapid notes, a dancer's short scuttling legs. He was really brilliant, and I wish I wrote more of these down, but I was too busy being totally captivated. At the end of the performance, Jamie Bernstein - Leonard Bernstein's daughter (WOAH! LEONARD BERNSTEIN'S DAUGHTER!) presented an award to Dudamel: the Leonard Bernstein Lifetime Achievement Award for the Elevation of Music in Society. "With this award," Jamie read aloud from the program, "Longy recognizes an artistic leader whose life has been dedicated to inspiring and enriching lives through music. The Bernstein laureate, whether as a performer or teacher" - and here she broke from the program and said "OR BOTH!" - "exemplifies how music can lift spirits, raise the level of culture in society, and transform lives." Dudamel said that he was part of the El Sistema family (the program in Venezuela that inspired Side by Side) and was receiving the award as part of that family and not as an individual. And then it was time to leave. Dudamel got the audience to give an extra gigantic round of applause for the little timpani player. "He's the best timpani player I have ever seen in an orchestra!" Dudamel announced. "Playing with one hand!" (the kid had a cast.) He gave the timpani player a hug, then turned outward and smiled at all of us. "I am becoming an old man," he said. "Because, when you feel like a father, you are becoming an old man." He left the stage, and the parents in the audience rushed up to be with their kids.   On Sunday morning the Design/Build/Fly team rolled out of bed at 6:30 AM, roughed up and ready to fly on the last day of the competition. We had one more mission to fly and we wanted to re-fly a mission as well in order to score a little higher. We were on the clock--the weather forecasted heavy rain and a thunderstorm starting around noon, in which case the competition would go on hold and awards would be given based on the current scores. The last mission was the emergency medical mission: the assignment was to carry a two-pound payload (distributed between four blocks arranged to simulate medical attendants standing next to patients on gurneys) for three laps around the course in as short a time as possible. We knew that our Corn Dog was the fastest plane at the competition--however, the heavy winds of Saturday showed no signs of dying down, and Corn Dog was a little worse for wear after yesterday's heavy flying. The time to beat was 1 minute and 55 seconds. Corn Dog's turn came while the sun was still out, and we quickly moved outside, packed the cargo into the payload bay, and got ready to fly.   Loading up. Corn Dog took off smoothly into the wind, turned around, and completed two and a half laps with no problems at all. As it came around the final turn to approach the finish line, a collective gasp went up from the crowd (along with fearful yelps and held breaths from we the team members) as Corn Dog yelped a loud SNAP and began making the very unhealthy-sounding buzzing sound of an electric razor. Corn Dog dipped out of the air--then fluttered back up again--then dipped again and charged forward through the finish line with a final time of 1 minute and 49 seconds. Success! But Corn Dog was still in the air, still buzzing loudly, and stumbling around looking like it had broken a leg. As we held our breaths and crossed our fingers, Adam (our pilot) turned Corn Dog around and landed it intact on the pavement.   Coming in literally on a wing and a prayer. Cue sighs of relief and thunderous applause.  Adam (who we are forever and ever indebted to for his amazing flying, and who has also guest-blogged for MITAdmissions), told us that he'd lost control of one of the ailerons (so Corn Dog was indeed a crippled dog for the last 100 feet or so of the flight). Examining the plane revealed that that aileron had undergone flutter, where it essentially resonates with the air going over it and vibrates wildly out of control. For Corn Dog, this meant that a lot of Bad Forces were exerted on the wing--and our beautiful composite wing layup buckled pretty badly. See those wrinkles? Those are caused by the Bad Forces put on the wing by the aileron flutter. As the more experienced members of the team set about the very delicate task of repairing and reinforcing our wing in anticipation of reflying our last mission and shaving a few more seconds off our time, the rest of us found lunch at Chipotle and then camped the scoreboard for updates. Eventually it refreshed, and there we were--with our punishing weight of 4.66 pounds balanced out by our excellent mission score (in fact, the highest mission score), we sat at a solid fifth place, ten points ahead of Penn State. Performing surgery on Corn Dog. We attempted a reflight later that afternoon, but our wing couldn't take it--as soon as we finished one lap, that uncomfortable buzzing sound returned and Adam quickly turned Corn Dog around and landed it before it exploded in flight. This time it was the other aileron that failed. We called it a wrap and spent the rest of the afternoon huddling in the wind and watching the other teams fly (and in many cases, crash) their planes between spats of rain and thunder. We're very happy with our fifth-place finish, but we also took home a few lessons from the competition. Predominant is the fact that, though Corn Dog was designed well and constructed beautifully, it was way too heavy--and therefore lost out to lighter planes that didn't perform as well on the missions. Corn Dog was a very structurally solid plane (hence why it's still in one piece), but that meant that Corn Dog was conservative. Planes that pushed the envelope a little more, using less power and less structure and flying a little less stably, gained more from the decreased weight than they lost in performance. The University of Southern California, for instance, had a mission score only 80 percent of ours--but since their plane was less than half the weight of Corn Dog, and mission score is divided by weight, USC finished with in first place with a whopping 407.24 while we settled in fifth with a meager 210.87. And so we packed up Corn Dog and came home to MIT. We're going to be bringing our A-game next year, though--so be prepared. Corn Dog, Jr. is on its way. For now, if you're ever in building 33, stop by the hangar and pay a visit to Corn Dog, one of the sexiest RC planes to ever fly the Kansas winds.
